code?\n[Array or single value?]{}\n\nA pointer can point to a single value or to an array $\\rightarrow$\nno way to infer it from its declaration\n\nDifferent syntax to destroy (= deallocate, free) the pointed object\nfor arrays and single objects\n\n\n``` {style=\"base\" gobble=\"4\"}\n    AliVTrack* FilterTracks();\nvoid UserExec()\n{\n  TLorentzVector *vect = new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0);\n

absolutely needed (if at all)\n\n[Usage Notes for ALICE Software]{}\n\n-   -   (therefore cannot be used as non-transient class members)\\\n\n    ``` {style=\"base\" gobble=\"4\"}\n        #if

not use it\n\nAlternative to pointers: arguments by reference (not covered here)\n\nAvoid raw pointers whenever possible!\n\nSmart pointers (unique_ptr and shared_ptr) should cover most use\ncases and provide a much more robust and safe memory management\n\n\nReferences\\\nEffective modern C++, Scott Meyers (O’Reilly

foo(SmallStruct s);\nvoid foo(SmallStruct& s);\nvoid foo(SmallStruct* s);\n\n  Solution Click to expandThere was no significant performance difference between passing small objects (or built-ins) by value, reference, or pointer.\n\n  Question Considering only performance, when should you pass large objects by value, reference and pointer?\nstruct LargeStruct { std::vector i };\n\nvoid foo(LargeStruct s);\nvoid foo(LargeStruct& s);\nvoid foo(LargeStruct* s);\n\n  Solution Click to expandPassing by value is the slowest since Foo's copy constructor is invoked for each call. Passing by reference or by pointer essentially copy a machine word — there's no significant difference.\n\n  Question Are there reasons to prefer one argument-passing mechanism to another?\n  Solution Click to expandThe difference between writing -> versus . is trivial. More important to writing clear code is the semantic difference between them.  Consider the following code:\nvoid foo(MyLargObj* p)\n{\n    p->bar();\n}\n\nPerhaps when you first wrote foo, it was called in one place, and you knew that p would always be valid.  Maybe you even wrote a comment for foo inidcating the precondition that p should never be NULL.  Inevitably, someone (maybe you) will pass NULL.  You might then feel the need to check p after all.\nvoid foo(MyLargObj* p)\n{\n    if (!p)\n        return;\n    p->bar();\n}\n\nThis can lead to other problems -- what if a post condition of foo() is that the postcondition of MyLargObj::bar hold?  Code executed later might still fail.  You might decide that throwing an exception is more appropriate.  You could get concerned about throwing an exception when checking a precondition and check on the internet for when it's appropriate.  You could be reading differing viewpoints on it for years, and if you don't immediately agree that you should assert, you'll probably do the wrong thing ;).\nNo matter what you choose, that choice was necessitated by the fact that pointers may assume invalid values. So, if passing in a value is truly optional, passing by pointer may be appropriate. If a precondition of the function requires no invalid values, consider pass-by-reference or pass-by-value — this more explicitly declares the domain of a given function.  Foo becomes:\nvoid foo(MyLargObj& p)\n{\n    p.bar();\n}\n\nWhich declares via the input type that invalid values for p are not allowed.  Passing by value may also be reasonable, but it depends on if changes to an object should be visible after the function is complete.\nA final consideration is that pointers carry a notion of ownership. Pointers often point to non-stack allocated objects (e.g., allocated using new), and should be deallocated when no longer needed. Lots of comments can be written indicating ownership — \"Ownership must be passed to this function, it will call delete,\" etc. Using references or values can reduce such error-prone commenting burden since they convey no notion of ownership. (Another way to address this, smart pointers, will be covered later. The discussion on the semantic differences between passing by reference and by value still applies in that case, however.)\n\n  Question What happens when passing a derived object as a base object?\nclass Base\n{\n    public:\n        virtual ~Base() {}\n        virtual void foo() const { std::cout foo(); }\n...\nDerived d;\nbar1(d);\nbar2(d);\nbar3(&d);\n\n  Solution Click to expandAll calls do not produce identical output — when a derived object is passed by value, only the 'base' copy constructor is called. Things that are not copied include the ability to call derived object virtual functions. This is known as the slicing problem. \n\n  Question What are the performance implications of returning large objects by value, reference and pointer?\nFoo return_by_value()\n{ return Foo(); }\nFoo& return_by_reference()\n{\n    //KLUDGE: We can't return a reference to an object whose lifetime ends\n    // after this function exits. Therefore we declare a local static.\n    // There are even kludgier methods for dealing with this, however.\n    static Foo s_f;\n    s_f = Foo();\n    return s_f;\n}\nFoo* return_by_pointer()\n{ return new Foo; }\n\n  Solution Click to expandThere are significant differences between return by value, reference and pointer; those differences may be surprising. Return by value was the fastest in my runs (.83 s), return by reference the slowest (1.37 s), and return by pointer in between (.90 s). All three require the construction and destruction of a Foo object. It may be useful to examine the differences:\nReturn by value: You might think this would be the slowest, arguing that it also requires a copy construction. That would have been true several years ago if optimizations were disabled on this code. In this case, the compiler noticed that the object constructed inside the function was going to be destructed after its values were copied. It was able to give the array of the to-be-destroyed object directly to the Foo object in the calling code [^2].\nReturn by reference: As written in the exercise, this is the slowest — perhaps surprisingly so. Its slowness is due to synchronization required when initializing local static variables. (The synchronization, aside from making high-latency calls, quadruples the number of instructions executed.)\nReturn by pointer: This is sometimes faster than return by value, sometimes slower — but usually around the same speed. This doesn't require the synchronization of return by reference, but does require a small heap allocation.\nThe details mentioned here aren't particularly important. The point of this exercise is that returning a large object by value may be the correct decision; concerns about the speed of returning by value are often unfounded and avoiding it is a case of premature pessimization. \n\n  Question What are the correctness concerns of using a local static to return by reference?\nFoo& return_by_reference()\n{\n    //KLUDGE: We can't return a reference to an object whose lifetime ends\n    // after this function exits. Therefore we declare a local static.\n    // There are even kludgier methods for dealing with this, however.\n    static Foo s_f;\n    s_f = Foo();\n    return s_f;\n}\n\nFoo& f1 = return_by_reference();\nFoo& f2 = return_by_reference();\nstd::cout \n  Solution Click to expandIf the first entry of f1 and f2 are different when printed, why do they compare equal? Since f1 refers to the same object as f2, f1 and f2 will always compare equal. The point? Local static (non-const) objects shouldn't be used as a way to avoid return by value. It is both wrong and slow.\n\n  Question Is there a difference in speed when stateful objects are involved?\nstruct Foo\n{\n    Foo() : v(10000) {};\n    std::vector return_by_value() const { return v; }\n    const std::vector& return_by_reference() const { return v; }\n    const std::vector* return_by_pointer() const { return &v; }\n    private:\n    std::vector v; \n};\n\n  Solution Click to expandThe timings are very different when returning an existing object. Return by value was 5000x slower than the other methods. In this case, return by value MUST call the copy constructor, while return by reference or pointer needed only return the address.\n\n  Question How should we decide between return by reference or pointer?\n  Solution Click to expandIf the object to be returned may not exist, return by pointer is natural, as NULL may serve as a sentinel value. Otherwise, return by reference is usually preferred, as that clearly indicates the object is valid. (Again, we'll ignore smart pointers and skip a discussion of ownership.)\n\n  Question What are the consequences of returning a local polymorphic object by value, reference and pointer?\n  Solution Click to expandReturning an object created in a function by value produces incorrect results as described in Q4. Returning by reference may produce correct results, but is more fragile. If a static object is referenced, the issues described in Q6 are present. Others returned *(new Derived()), which will produce correct results and avoid the slowness of the static object; however, the complexity of ensuring that referenced object is destructed correctly is still reason enough to avoid it. Return by pointer should be preferred in this case.\n\n  Question When should we pass by value, reference and pointer?\n  Solution Click to expandPass small objects    by value: Yes, if not polymorphic and changes inside the function should not be present outside the function\nPass small objects by reference: Yes, if no need for a sentinel value\nPass small objects by pointer: Yes, if a sentinel value is needed\nPass large objects by value: Only if the function actually needs a separate copy of the object\nPass large objects by reference: Yes, if no need for a sentinel value\nPass large objects by pointer: Yes, if a sentinel value is needed\nPass polymorphic objects by value: No\nPass polymorphic objects by reference: Yes, if no need for a sentinel value\nPass polymorphic objects by pointer: Yes, if a sentinel value is needed\n\n  Question When should we return by value, reference and pointer?\n  Solution Click to expandReturn small objects by value: Yes, if not polymorphic\nReturn small objects by reference: Only if the returned object's will exist after the function is exited \nReturn small objects by pointer: Yes, if a sentinel value is needed or the object cannot be on the stack \nReturn large objects by value: Yes, unless the object's lifetime exceeds the function call, or measurements show that this impacts performance\nReturn large objects by reference Yes, if no need for a sentinel value and the object's lifetime exceeds the function call.\nReturn large objects by pointer: Yes, if a sentinel value is needed and the object's lifetime exceeds the function call\nReturn polymorphic objects by value: No\nReturn polymorphic objects by reference: Yes, if no need for a sentinel value and object lifetime exceeds function scope\nReturn polymorphic objects by pointer: Yes, if a sentinel value is needed or return by reference is otherwise inappropriate\n\n"},"analysis/newf2/smartp.html":{"url":"analysis/newf2/smartp.html","title":"Smart pointers","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nWhat is a pointer?\n\nA pointer is an object whose value “points to” another value stored\nsomewhere else in memory\n\nit contains a memory address\n\nobtaining the stored at the pointed location\n\nvery flexible and powerful tool\n\n\nUsing a pointer\n    /* Defining a pointer */\n    int* a; // declares a pointer that can point to an integer value\n    //DANGER: the pointer points to a random memory portion!\n\n    int* b = nullptr; // OK, pointer is initialised to a null memory address\n\n    int* c = new int; // allocate memory for an integer value in the heap\n    //and assign its memory address to this pointer\n\n    int** d = &a; // this pointer points to a pointer to an integer value\n\n    MyObject* e = new MyObject(); // allocate memory for MyObject\n    // and assign its memory address to the pointer e\n\n    /* Using a pointer */\n    int f = *c; // dereferencing a pointer and assigning the pointed\n    // value to another integer variable\n\n    e->DoSomething(); // dereferencing a pointer and calling\n    // the method DoSomething() of the instance of MyObject\n    // pointed by e\n\nWhy a raw pointer is hard to love\nMemory leaks\n  What is the problem with this code?Below is a snippet of analysis code.

However, it's common for those recently acquainted with smart pointers to ignore the overloaded operators out of either ignorance or a misplaced fear of performance degradation.  Change the following code using .get() to have a more natural syntax:\n  std::unique_ptr pBar(new Bar);\n\n  foo(*(pBar.get()));\n\n  pBar.get()->x();\n\n  if(pBar.get())\n  {\n    //Do some stuff...\n  }\n\n SolutionClick to expandBecomes:\n   std::unique_ptr pBar(new Bar);\n-  foo(*(pBar.get()));\n+  foo(*pBar);\n-  pBar.get()->x();\n+  pBar->x();\n-  if(pBar.get())\n+  if(pBar)\n   {\n     //Do some stuff...\n   }\n\n\n QuestionWhen should .get() be used on a smart pointer?\n SolutionClick to expandUsually when code outside your control requires a raw pointer -- but not ownership of the pointer.  Herb Sutter has also argued that in modern code, a raw pointer may indicate that the caller should do nothing with ownership (i.e., don't delete it).  Our codebase probably isn't modern enough to allow this -- too many instances of raw pointers still conveying ownership..\n\n Questionunique_ptr::release has a similar signature to unique_ptr::get.  How is it different?\n SolutionClick to expandThat should be called when passing ownership of the pointer elsewhere.  For example, the GUI toolkit wxWidgets expects heap-allocated[^0] objects which it will delete once it's done using them.  release on unique_ptr means that unique_ptr will no longer hold that pointer, nor attempt to delete it -- otherwise it wouldn't be unique.  See the next training for gotchas when releasing unique_ptrs.\n\n QuestionIt would be possible to allow the following code to compile.  What could happen if shared_ptr or unique_ptr were changed to allow it?\nvoid foo1(int*) {}\n\nstd::shared_ptr pInt(new int(5));\nfoo1(pInt);\n\n SolutionClick to expandFirstly, calling foo1 as shown will fail, since you can't implicitly convert shared_ptr to T*.  If such a conversion were added, foo1(pInt) would compile & work, but delete pInt; would merely compile -- delete would be called twice on that pointer.  (It would probably work until your software was unserviceable -- e.g., deployed on a satellite.  This is in keeping with software's reputation for being spiteful.)  Accidentally calling delete as shown could happen if you were trying to replace raw pointers with smart pointers in legacy code.\n\n QuestionIt would be possible to allow the following code to compile.  What could happen if shared_ptr or unique_ptr were changed to allow it?\nstd::unique_ptr pInt2 = new int(5);\n\n SolutionClick to expandThe previous code would require unique_ptr to be implicitly constructable from T*.  Suppose you had legacy code like this:\nfoo2(int* pInt)\n{...}\n\n...\n\nint* pMyInt = new int(42);\nfoo2(pMyInt);\n*pMyInt = 43;\n\nThen, using shiny new smart_ptrs, you changed part, but didn't see the later code:\nfoo2(const std::unique_ptr& pInt)\n{...}\n\n...\n\nint* pMyInt = new int(42);\nfoo2(pMyInt);\n*pMyInt = 43; //Earth-shattering kaboom!\n\nAs designed, the compiler will produce an error in the second case.  It's still possible to have exactly these problems, but you need to go out of your way to get them.  Code should be written to protect against Murphy (accidental misuse), not Machiavelli (deliberate attempts to misuse) [^1].  (This is not speaking in reference to sanitizing user input, which you should usually assume to be dangerous.)\n\n QuestionThe following contains a mistake.  Fix it, and explain why it was wrong.\nstd::shared_ptr p1(new int(42));\nstd::shared_ptr p2(p1.get());\n\n SolutionClick to expandp1 and p2 will both attempt to delete the same pointer, without knowing the other exists.  A shared_ptr counts the number of pointers referencing the same pointer and deallocates that pointer once no one is referencing it.  With code like the previous, we get the following:\nstd::shared_ptr p1(new int(42));//p1 references the new pointer, reference count = 1\nstd::shared_ptr p2(p1.get());//p2 thinks it's the only guy looking at the pointer, reference count = 1\n//(automatically called) p2.~shared_ptr() -- deletes the pointer in p2\n//(automatically called) p1.~shared_ptr() -- Oops, p1's pointer was already deleted!\n\nThe correct way to ensure the reference counts are correct is to copy the shared_ptr, not just the underlying pointer:\nstd::shared_ptr p1(new int(42));//p1 references the new pointer, reference count = 1\nstd::shared_ptr p2(p1);//p2 references p1's pointer & p1's reference count, reference count = 2\n//(automatically called) p2.~shared_ptr() -- decrements the reference count ( = 1 )\n//(automatically called) p1.~shared_ptr() -- decrements the reference count to zero and deletes the pointer.\n\n\n QuestionThe following contains a mistake.  Fix it, and explain why it was wrong.\nstd::unique_ptr p3(new int[42]);\n\n SolutionClick to expandstd::unique_ptr will call delete on its pointer -- that means the pointer should be allocated using new.  If we want to use new[N], we should store it in std::unique_ptr, which will correctly call delete[].  Furthermore, it offers operator[] and disallows operator* & operator->, which makes it less awkward to index elements after the first.\n\n QuestionWhen would you use a unique_ptr versus a shared_ptr?\n SolutionClick to expandUse shared_ptr when you know that ownership of the pointer must be shared in more than one place.  Note that ownership == responsability to deallocate the pointer.\nUse unique_ptr when you don't know that ownership of the pointer must be shared.\n\n QuestionSuppose you have a class which returns a pointer which the user may wish to store in a shared_ptr.  What type should you return?\n SolutionClick to expandReturn a unique_ptr to that type.  unique_ptrs are convertible to shared_ptrs, so returning a unique_ptr prevents memory leaks without restricting how that pointer is used later.\nReturning a raw pointer instead would certainly work, but goes against, e.g., Scott Meyers's advice to \"make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.\"  (See Item 18 of Effective C++.)\n\n QuestionThe following code opens a handle to a file using the C-style FILE* interface\nand closes the handle before returning.\n\n  FILE* pFin = NULL;\n  try\n  {\n    std::string filename(\"c:\\\\Windows\\\\win.ini\");\n    pFin = std::fopen(filename.c_str(), \"r\");\n    if (!pFin)\n      return;\n\n    char data[10];\n    if (std::fread(data, 1, 10, pFin) \nWe could change it to use\niostreams, but for this exercise, change the code to just use a smart\npointer (std::shared_ptr) to FILE with a custom deleter, so that the\nfclose() call doesn't have to appear in so many places, and eliminate the\ntry-catch block.\n SolutionClick to expand:\n    std::string filename(\"c:\\\\Windows\\\\win.ini\");\n    std::shared_ptr pFin(std::fopen(filename.c_str(), \"r\"), &std::fclose);\n    if (!pFin)\n      return;\n\n    char data[10];\n    if (std::fread(data, 1, 10, pFin.get()) \nNotice that not only do the fclose() calls go away, but also the try/catch block goes away, since there's no longer a need to call fclose() and then re-throw.\n\n QuestionWhat could you do if your deleter had a declaration that didn't match the \nvoid(T*) interface that the smart pointers expect?\n SolutionClick to expandUse the adapter pattern to wrap the deleter with the appropriate interface.  One easy way is to wrap it in a lambda which does match that declaration.\n\n QuestionWhy is the weak_ptr class designed such that we have to convert the weak_ptr\ninto a shared_ptr before using the object the weak pointer refers to?\n SolutionClick to expandYou must obtain a reference to the object to insure that it is not deleted\nwhile the code is accessing it.\n\n QuestionAssuming that p_int's lifetime is managed in a separate thread of execution, what could happen if the code were structured like this:\nif (!p_weak_int.expired())\n{\n  auto p_tmp_copy = p_weak_int.lock();\n  std::cout \n SolutionClick to expandConsider what would happen if instruction interleaving caused the pointer to be deleted\nbetween the call to expired and the call to lock -- the next line would (hopefully) crash!\n\n QuestionIn the un-threaded example above, a raw pointer would've served just as well as a\nstd::weak_ptr. However, suppose we had 3 threads, each owning one copy\nof the std::shared_ptr (so its reference count is 3). Suppose each thread\ncould terminate at any time (thus decreasing the reference count until it\nreaches 0 and the memory is freed). The main thread has a std::weak_ptr\ncopy and is monitoring/reporting its value periodically.\nNow what benefit(s) might using a std::weak_ptr provide over using a copy\nof the raw pointer?\n SolutionClick to expandIf we had a raw pointer we wouldn't be able to test if it still points to\nanything valid (the value of the pointer doesn't get changed), whereas with \na weak_ptr, we can test if the pointer is still valid.\n\n Questionauto p_unique = get_unique_ptr(my_lib.open_handle(),\n[&](int* p_handle) { my_lib.close_handle(p_handle); });\n\n//Now suppose we need to change to a shared_ptr:\nstd::shared_ptr p_shared(p_unique.release());\n\nWhat's wrong with the conversion to shared_ptr and why does it cause a\ncrash?\n SolutionClick to expandThe custom deleter is not transferred from the unique_ptr to the shared_ptr when you use release().  Therefore, when the shared_ptr goes out of scope, it calls delete on the raw pointer instead of the custom deleter.\n\n QuestionThe fix for the above looks like this:\nstd::shared_ptr p_shared(std::move(p_unique));\n\nRewrite the code above. Why do you have to use std::move()?\n SolutionClick to expand:\nunique_ptr cannot be copied, as that would not provide unique ownership\nof the pointer.  unique_ptr can be moved from.  This allows unique_ptr to\nbe returned from functions, used in std containers, and more.  std::move\nexplicitly moves the pointer out of p_unique into p_shared.\n\n QuestionWhen we copied a shared_ptr to another shared_ptr, we didn't have to use\nstd::move(). Why not?\n SolutionClick to expandBecause shared_ptrs are copy assignable whereas unique_ptrs are not.  With\na unique_ptr, we have to help transfer ownership through the move because\nownership can not be copied.\nIt seems that explicitly calling std::move is usually only necessary when\nwriting move constructors and move assignment operators.  (There are other\ncases, like when writing algorithms, but moves are usually safest\n(and fastest!) when implicitly generated.)\n\n Question//We have a unique_ptr to const and we want to switch to a unique_ptr to\n// non-const:\nstd::unique_ptr p_const_unique(new int(5));\n//std::unique_ptr p_my_non_const_int(std::move(p_const_unique));\n\nIf you uncomment the line above, it won't compile.  Why not?\n SolutionClick to expandJust as with raw pointers, converting a pointer to const to a pointer to\nnon-const will fail.\nFrom a higher-level point of view, if this conversion were allowed, \nthen the following could happen.\nstd::unique_ptr p_const_unique(new int(5));\nstd::unique_ptr p_my_non_const_int(std::move(p_const_unique));\n// We are changing the value of something originally declared const!\n*p_my_non_const_int = 4;\n\n\n Question//We have a shared_ptr and we want to convert it to a unique_ptr:\nstd::shared_ptr p_shared_int(new int(6));\n//std::unique_ptr p_unique_int(std::move(p_shared_int));\n\nIf you uncomment the line above, it won't compile. Why not?\nYou can create a shared_ptr from a unique_ptr, so why can't you create a\nunique_ptr from a shared_ptr?\n SolutionClick to expand:\nSimple answer: It would require that all others who have a shared_ptr to a\nresource to give it up, which isn't realistically possible in C++.\nLess-simple answer: While shared_ptr has a unique member function which indicates if more than one copy of it exists, it seems the committee didn't find once-shared-but-now-unique a common enough use-case to merit a conversion.  Since you can check uniqueness at runtime, nothing stops you from acting as if the shared_ptr were a unique_ptr once you've checked.\n\n QuestionConsider the following code:\nboost::shared_ptr int1(new int(42));\n\nHow many allocations were required?  What was the size of each allocation?\n SolutionClick to expandFor 32-bit VC10, two allocations were required, 4 bytes for the first, 16 bytes for the second.\nFor 64-bit VC10, two allocations were required, 4 bytes for the first, 24 bytes for the second.\nThere are two allocations for a single shared_ptr, one for the data being pointed to (what's returned by std::shared_ptr::get) and one for the reference count (so co-owning shared pointers know where to look to see how many other referrers there are).\n\n QuestionHow many allocations were required?  What was the size of each allocation?\n SolutionClick to expandmake_shared allocates the object pointed to and the reference count at the same time.  Essentially, it creates one struct which holds both pieces of data.  Thus:\nFor 32-bit VC10, one 16-byte allocation was required.\nFor 64-bit VC10, one 24-byte allocation was required.\nIf you used any other standard library, you probably got one 24-byte allocation (on 32-bit systems) or one 32-byte allocation (on 64-bit systems). Why are none of the sizes equal to the sum of the individual allocations?  See below.\n\n QuestionConsider the following code:\nint foo() { throw std::runtime_error(\"Normally conditional\");  return 5; }\n\nvoid bar(std::shared_ptr int, int val)\n{}\n\nvoid example2()\n{\n  bar(std::shared_ptr(new int(42)), foo());\n}\n\nWhy could calling example2 result in a memory leak?\n SolutionClick to expandC++ arguments may be evaluated in unspecified order.  In the previous, the shared_ptr constructor and foo() must both be evaluated before bar is called, but there is no requirement that the shared_ptr constructor be called before foo() is evaluated.  Thus the order of operations could be:\nnew int(42)\nfoo()\nand the shared_ptr constructor might never be called, as foo() threw and exception.\nThis is explicitly warned about in the shared_ptr docs.  So two solutions are:\nstd::shared_ptr int(new int(42)); //Less freedom to reorder statements.\nbar(int, foo());\n\nor\nbar(std::make_shared(42), foo());//No problems, make_shared won't be split to call foo().\n\n\n Questionstd::make_shared always uses the std::allocator to retrieve memory.  What should we use if we have a different allocator?\n SolutionClick to expandstd::allocate_shared\n\n QuestionConsider the following two ways to allocate an array:\nvoid example3()\n{\n  int* int1 = new int[42];\n  delete [] int1;\n\n  std::shared_ptr int2(new int[42], [](int* p) { delete [] p; });\n}\n\nBoth have drawbacks.  Using boost::shared_ptr as of 1.53 you can write:\nboost::shared_ptr int3(new int[42]);\n\nor\nauto int4 = boost::make_shared(42);//make_shared_noinit is actually functionally equivalent. . .\n\nThe drawbacks to the code for int1 in example3 are obvious, since RAII classes protect against memory leaks.  int2 has drawbacks that aren't quite as obvious.  Name at least one drawback to storing an array in a shared_ptr.\n SolutionClick to expandDrawback #1: How do you access the second element of the array?  int2[1] doesn't compile, as there's no overloaded operator[].  You end up having to write something like int2.get()[1], which is probably why languages without pointers are so popular these days.  On the flip side, it can be argued that being able to access * and -> can lead to issues for arrays -- it might be better to require [0] instead.\nDrawback #2: \nThe code for specifying an array deleter is verbose.  It can be slightly prettier if you write std::default_delete, but it's long enough to be a pain to type much.\nDrawback #3 (subtle):\nConsider the following code\nstruct B {};\nstruct D : public B { std::array vals };\n\nstd::shared_ptr p_B(new D);//Okay. . .\nstd::shared_ptr bs(new D[24]);//Awful!\n\nIf you're not seeing what's wrong immediately, that's because it's subtle.  In More Effective C++, Scott Meyers goes farther than his normal counsel to \"avoid\" things.  He states \"never treat arrays polymorphically.\"  And he's right!  Moving from one element to the next in an array requires pointer arithmetic.  If each element is actually further apart than sizeof(B), then the pointer arithmetic will be wrong, and you won't access D[1] when you write pB[1].\nHappily, with the new boost::shared_ptr type code like that above will fail to compile:\nboost::shared_ptr bs(new D[24]);//Compile error!\n\nwhile allowing other, safe conversions to take place:\nboost::shared_ptr bs(new B[24]);//non-const to const okay. . .\n\nUsing smart pointers can dramatically improve the safety of your code.  It allows you to convey ownership semantics using something more than comments, while preventing memory leaks and potential double-deletions that come from improper memory leak fixes.\n\n"},"analysis/parallellism.html":{"url":"analysis/parallellism.html","title":"Part 4 - Parallellism","keywords":"","body":"paralellism\n"},"analysis/parallell/intro.html":{"url":"analysis/parallell/intro.html","title":"Threads and processes","keywords":"","body":"Threads and processes\nIn computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.[1] The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its variables at any given time. \n Threads differ from traditional multitasking operating system processes in that:\n\nprocesses are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process\nprocesses carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources\nprocesses have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space\nprocesses interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms\ncontext switching between threads in the same process is typically faster than context switching between processes.\n\nSystems such as Windows NT and OS/2 are said to have cheap threads and expensive processes; in other operating systems there is not so great a difference except the cost of an address space switch which on some architectures (notably x86) results in a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) flush. \nSingle threading\nIn computer programming, single-threading is the processing of one command at a time. The opposite of single-threading is multithreading.\nIn the formal analysis of the variables' semantics and process state the term single threading can be used differently to mean \"backtracking within a single thread\", which is common in the functional programming community.\nMultithreading\nMultithreading is mainly found in multitasking operating systems. Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. Multithreading can also be applied to one process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.\nAdvantages\n\nResponsiveness: multithreading can allow an application to remain responsive to input. In a one-thread program, if the main execution thread blocks on a long-running task, the entire application can appear to freeze. By moving such long-running tasks to a worker thread that runs concurrently with the main execution thread, it is possible for the application to remain responsive to user input while executing tasks in the background. On the other hand, in most cases multithreading is not the only way to keep a program responsive, with non-blocking I/O and/or Unix signals being available for gaining similar results.[6]\nFaster execution: this advantage of a multithreaded program allows it to operate faster on computer systems that have multiple central processing units (CPUs) or one or more multi-core processors, or across a cluster of machines, because the threads of the program naturally lend themselves to parallel execution, assuming sufficient independence (that they do not need to wait for each other).\nLower resource consumption: using threads, an application can serve multiple clients concurrently using fewer resources than it would need when using multiple process copies of itself. For example, the Apache HTTP server uses thread pools: a pool of listener threads for listening to incoming requests, and a pool of server threads for processing those requests.\nBetter system utilization: as an example, a file system using multiple threads can achieve higher throughput and lower latency since data in a faster medium (such as cache memory) can be retrieved by one thread while another thread retrieves data from a slower medium (such as external storage) with neither thread waiting for the other to finish.\nSimplified sharing and communication: unlike processes, which require a message passing or shared memory mechanism to perform inter-process communication (IPC), threads can communicate through data, code and files they already share.\nParallelization: applications looking to use multicore or multi-CPU systems can use multithreading to split data and tasks into parallel subtasks and let the underlying architecture manage how the threads run, either concurrently on one core or in parallel on multiple cores. GPU computing environments like CUDA and OpenCL use the multithreading model where dozens to hundreds of threads run in parallel across data on a large number of cores.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nSynchronization: since threads share the same address space, the programmer must be careful to avoid race conditions and other non-intuitive behaviors. In order for data to be correctly manipulated, threads will often need to rendezvous in time in order to process the data in the correct order. Threads may also require mutually exclusive operations (often implemented using mutexes) in order to prevent common data from being simultaneously modified or read while in the process of being modified. Careless use of such primitives can lead to deadlocks, livelocks or races over resources.\nThread crashes a process: an illegal operation performed by a thread crashes the entire process; therefore, one misbehaving thread can disrupt the processing of all the other threads in the application.\n\nConcurrency and data structures\nThreads in the same process share the same address space. This allows concurrently running code to couple tightly and conveniently exchange data without the overhead or complexity of an IPC. When shared between threads, however, even simple data structures become prone to race conditions if they require more than one CPU instruction to update: two threads may end up attempting to update the data structure at the same time and find it unexpectedly changing underfoot. Bugs caused by race conditions can be very difficult to reproduce and isolate.\nTo prevent this, threading application programming interfaces (APIs) offer synchronization primitives such as mutexes to lock data structures against concurrent access. On uniprocessor systems, a thread running into a locked mutex must sleep and hence trigger a context switch. On multi-processor systems, the thread may instead poll the mutex in a spinlock. Both of these may sap performance and force processors in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems to contend for the memory bus, especially if the granularity of the locking is fine. \nI/O and scheduling\nUser thread or fiber implementations are typically entirely in userspace. As a result, context switching between user threads or fibers within the same process is extremely efficient because it does not require any interaction with the kernel at all: a context switch can be performed by locally saving the CPU registers used by the currently executing user thread or fiber and then loading the registers required by the user thread or fiber to be executed. Since scheduling occurs in userspace, the scheduling policy can be more easily tailored to the requirements of the program's workload.\nHowever, the use of blocking system calls in user threads (as opposed to kernel threads) or fibers can be problematic. If a user thread or a fiber performs a system call that blocks, the other user threads and fibers in the process are unable to run until the system call returns. A typical example of this problem is when performing I/O: most programs are written to perform I/O synchronously. When an I/O operation is initiated, a system call is made, and does not return until the I/O operation has been completed. In the intervening period, the entire process is \"blocked\" by the kernel and cannot run, which starves other user threads and fibers in the same process from executing.\nA common solution to this problem is providing an I/O API that implements a synchronous interface by using non-blocking I/O internally, and scheduling another user thread or fiber while the I/O operation is in progress. Similar solutions can be provided for other blocking system calls. Alternatively, the program can be written to avoid the use of synchronous I/O or other blocking system calls.\nSunOS 4.x implemented light-weight processes or LWPs. NetBSD 2.x+, and DragonFly BSD implement LWPs as kernel threads (1:1 model). SunOS 5.2 through SunOS 5.8 as well as NetBSD 2 to NetBSD 4 implemented a two level model, multiplexing one or more user level threads on each kernel thread (M:N model). SunOS 5.9 and later, as well as NetBSD 5 eliminated user threads support, returning to a 1:1 model.[9] FreeBSD 5 implemented M:N model. FreeBSD 6 supported both 1:1 and M:N, users could choose which one should be used with a given program using /etc/libmap.conf. Starting with FreeBSD 7, the 1:1 became the default. FreeBSD 8 no longer supports the M:N model.\nThe use of kernel threads simplifies user code by moving some of the most complex aspects of threading into the kernel. The program does not need to schedule threads or explicitly yield the processor. User code can be written in a familiar procedural style, including calls to blocking APIs, without starving other threads. However, kernel threading may force a context switch between threads at any time, and thus expose race hazards and concurrency bugs that would otherwise lie latent. On SMP systems, this is further exacerbated because kernel threads may literally execute on separate processors in parallel. \n"},"analysis/parallell/example.html":{"url":"analysis/parallell/example.html","title":"Posix multithreading","keywords":"","body":"C++ Multithreading\nMultithreading is a specialized form of multitasking and a multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. In general, there are two types of multitasking: process-based and thread-based.\nProcess-based multitasking handles the concurrent execution of programs. Thread-based multitasking deals with the concurrent execution of pieces of the same program.\nA multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.\nC++ does not contain any built-in support for multithreaded applications. Instead, it relies entirely upon the operating system to provide this feature.\nThis tutorial assumes that you are working on Linux OS and we are going to write multi-threaded C++ program using POSIX. POSIX Threads, or Pthreads provides API which are available on many Unix-like POSIX systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris.\nCreating threads\nThe following routine is used to create a POSIX thread\n#include \npthread_create (thread, attr, start_routine, arg)\n\nHere, pthread_create creates a new thread and makes it executable. This routine can be called any number of times from anywhere within your code. Here is the description of the parameters −\n\nthread: An opaque, unique identifier for the new thread returned by the subroutine.\nattr: An opaque attribute object that may be used to set thread attributes. You can specify a thread attributes object, or NULL for the default values.     \nstart_routine: the C++ routine that the thread will execute once it is created\narg: A single argument that may be passed to start_routine. It must be passed by reference as a pointer cast of type void. NULL may be used if no argument is to be passed\n\nThe maximum number of threads that may be created by a process is implementation dependent. Once created, threads are peers, and may create other threads. There is no implied hierarchy or dependency between threads.\nTerminating Threads\nThere is following routine which we use to terminate a POSIX thread −\n#include \npthread_exit (status)\n\nHere pthread_exit is used to explicitly exit a thread. Typically, the pthread_exit() routine is called after a thread has completed its work and is no longer required to exist.\nIf main() finishes before the threads it has created, and exits with pthread_exit(), the other threads will continue to execute. Otherwise, they will be automatically terminated when main() finishes.\nExample\nExample\nThis simple example code creates 5 threads with the pthread_create() routine. Each thread prints a \"Hello World!\" message, and then terminates with a call to pthread_exit(). \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define NUM_THREADS 5\n\nvoid *PrintHello(void *threadid) {\n   long tid;\n   tid = (long)threadid;\n   cout \nCompile the following program using -lpthread library as follows \n$gcc test.cpp -lpthread\n\nNow, execute your program which gives the following output\nmain() : creating thread, 0\nmain() : creating thread, 1\nmain() : creating thread, 2\nmain() : creating thread, 3\nmain() : creating thread, 4\nHello World! Thread ID, 0\nHello World! Thread ID, 1\nHello World! Thread ID, 2\nHello World! Thread ID, 3\nHello World! Thread ID, 4\n\nPassing Arguments to Threads\nThis example shows how to pass multiple arguments via a structure. You can pass any data type in a thread callback because it points to void as explained in the following example\n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define NUM_THREADS 5\n\nstruct thread_data {\n   int  thread_id;\n   char *message;\n};\n\nvoid *PrintHello(void *threadarg) {\n   struct thread_data *my_data;\n   my_data = (struct thread_data *) threadarg;\n\n   cout thread_id ;\n   cout message \nWhen the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −\nmain() : creating thread, 0\nmain() : creating thread, 1\nmain() : creating thread, 2\nmain() : creating thread, 3\nmain() : creating thread, 4\nThread ID : 3 Message : This is message\nThread ID : 2 Message : This is message\nThread ID : 0 Message : This is message\nThread ID : 1 Message : This is message\nThread ID : 4 Message : This is message\n\nJoining and Detaching Threads\nThere are following two routines which we can use to join or detach threads\npthread_join (threadid, status) \npthread_detach (threadid)\n\nThe pthread_join() subroutine blocks the calling thread until the specified threadid thread terminates. When a thread is created, one of its attributes defines whether it is joinable or detached. Only threads that are created as joinable can be joined. If a thread is created as detached, it can never be joined.\nThis example demonstrates how to wait for thread completions by using the Pthread join routine.\n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define NUM_THREADS 5\n\nvoid *wait(void *t) {\n   int i;\n   long tid;\n\n   tid = (long)t;\n\n   sleep(1);\n   cout \nWhen the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −\nmain() : creating thread, 0\nmain() : creating thread, 1\nmain() : creating thread, 2\nmain() : creating thread, 3\nmain() : creating thread, 4\nSleeping in thread\nThread with id : 0 .... exiting\nSleeping in thread\nThread with id : 1 .... exiting\nSleeping in thread\nThread with id : 2 .... exiting\nSleeping in thread\nThread with id : 3 .... exiting\nSleeping in thread\nThread with id : 4 .... exiting\nMain: completed thread id :0  exiting with status :0\nMain: completed thread id :1  exiting with status :0\nMain: completed thread id :2  exiting with status :0\nMain: completed thread id :3  exiting with status :0\nMain: completed thread id :4  exiting with status :0\nMain: program exiting.\n\n"},"analysis/parallell/caveats.html":{"url":"analysis/parallell/caveats.html","title":"What can go wrong?","keywords":"","body":"Race conditions\nA race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are \"racing\" to access/change the data.\nProblems often occur when one thread does a \"check-then-act\" (e.g. \"check\" if the value is X, then \"act\" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the \"check\" and the \"act\". E.g:\nif (x == 5) // The \"Check\"\n{\n   y = x * 2; // The \"Act\"\n\n   // If another thread changed x in between \"if (x == 5)\" and \"y = x * 2\" above,\n   // y will not be equal to 10.\n}\n\nThe point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.\nIn order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:\n// Obtain lock for x\nif (x == 5)\n{\n   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. \n              // Therefore y = 10\n}\n// release lock for x\n\nPutting a race condition in practice: expanding our example\n"},"analysis/parallell/root.html":{"url":"analysis/parallell/root.html","title":"Parallellism with ROOT","keywords":"","body":" simple parallellism with root6 \n"},"analysis/changes.html":{"url":"analysis/changes.html","title":"Part 5 - Changes to user code","keywords":"","body":"Transition from ROOT5 to ROOT6\nROOT6 is similar to ROOT5: It comes with the same library of classes (base\nclasses, histogram classes like TH1, ...) which share the same interface as under\nROOT5. It provides a command line interface as ROOT5, and runs macros just\nlike under ROOT5. Therefore it is possible to build and run the ALICE\nsimulation, reconstruction and analysis framework under ROOT6. AliPhysics can be\nbuilt against ROOT6 in the following way:\naliBuild -z --defaults root6 build AliPhysics\n\nFor classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics this transition is transparent. For code in\nmacros there are however a few difference. This page tries to summarize the\ndifferences in behaviour observed so far and gives some suggestions how to solve\nthese issues so work can go on smoothly under ROOT6.\nWhat is a just-in-time compiler?\nFor the command line interface and running macros ROOT5 uses CINT, which is an\ninterpreter for C/C++. An interpreter processes a macro line-by-line. It depends\non the implementation of the interpreter how C++ code will be handled and how\nclose the interpretation comes to the language standard. ROOT5 allows for some\ndeviations from the language standards, which means that some coding errors\nwhich would thrown by a compiler leading in a break of the compilation are still\ntolerated by ROOT5. Furthermore the standard library is not fully supported as\nits handling has to be implemented into the compiler. Macro can however also be\nrun in the compiled mode by ROOT5 (adding a \"+\" to the macro name). In this case\nROOT calls an external compiler to compile the macro to a library which is loaded\ninto ROOT. Once the macro runs in compiled mode it is expected to be fully\ncompatible with the C++ standard and coding error free as the compiler will not\ntolerate compiler errors.\nIn contrast to this ROOT6 uses a just-in-time compiler called cling. A\njust-in-time compiler translates each statement, no matter whether it is a single\ncommand or a complicated macro, into machine code as it would be a program and\nonly afterwards runs this piece of code. In order to translate code into machine\ncode the compiler must know how to translate every single line. Based on powerful\ncompiler library this means for ROOT6 that all macro must comply to 100% with\nthe C++ language standard, and exceptions will not be tolerated. Furthermore this\nalso means that all symbols and objects must be known at compile time. This has\nthree side effects:\n\nLoading Functions with gROOT->LoadMacro(...);: This function loads all\nfunctions it finds within the macro into ROOT during run time. For an interpreter\nthis is sufficient as the functions are used after they are loaded. However the\ncompiler must know all symbols used in a macro at compile time.\nLoading libraries with gSystem->Load(...);: Here we have the same problem:\nThe symbols in the libraries must be known before they are used.\nCompiling ALICE analysis tasks on the fly with gROOT->LoadMacro(\"...+\");:\nAs the analysis task compiled like this will be converted in a library it must be\nknow to the just-in-time compiler before.\n\nFor all three cases exist workarounds which will be discussed in the next\nsections. In general macros which were running under ROOT5 in the compiled mode\nwill also run under ROOT6. Macros which were running only in the interpreted\nmode might contain coding errors which were not handled by ROOT5 and might\ntherefore need fixes. However the just-in-time compiler will give precise error\nmessages leading exactly to the lines which need fixes.\nHow can I call macros inside macros?\nCalling macros inside macros is a bit tricky as the result of a macro will be\navailable only at runtime. There are however several workarounds which cover the \nmost common use cases:\n\nUsing ROOT's TMacro:\nTMacro is a wrapper class around the macro processing. It is constructed with\nthe macro path. The macro is run using TMacro::Exec. The result of\nTMacro::Exec() is a number representing an address in memory where to\nfind the resulting object. This has to be cast into a pointer to an object of\nthe expected type. Example:\nTMacro physseladd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"));\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(physseladd.Exec());\n\nThe macro is still evaluated at runtime, however with the reinterpret_cast to\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask * we tell ROOT that the result of the macro\ninterpretation must be of type AliPhysicsSelectionTask *, so the type is known\nat compile time. TMacro::Exec optionally gets a string representation of the\nfunction arguments. This might be a bit complicated to handle, particularly if\nthe arguments are dynamic and change at run time. The method works both for\nROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nUsing gROOT/gInterpreter->ProcessLine: \nMacro execution can be launched as well via gROOT->ProcessLine() /\ngInterpreter->ProcessLine(). As with TMacro this method is focused on running\na macro and not loading content from it. The ProcessLine method returns a\nlong number representing an address in memory where to find the output objects.\nThis number has to be cast to the expected output type using a\nreinterpret_cast in order to access the content of the output objects. The\nfollowing example runs the add macro for the physics selection task:\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ProcessLine(Form(\".x %s\", gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"))))\n\nAdding function arguments is possible here as well as a simple string\nrepresentation after the macro path, surrounded with (). This method also works\nboth under ROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nIncluding macros:\nAs ROOT6 compiles the macro it is possible to include macros and treat them\nas if they were header files. In order for this to work it is essential to tell\nROOT before where to find the macro. This can be done using the preprocessor\nmacro R_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH(...). For the just-in-time compiler macros\nincluded will look as if they were part of the code itself. The following macro\nruns under ROOT6:\n#ifdef __CLING__\n// Tell  ROOT where to find AliRoot headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_ROOT)\n#include \n\n// Tell ROOT where to find AliPhysics headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_PHYSICS)\n#include \n#endif\n\nvoid simpleaddtest(){\n  AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager;\n\n  // Take function from macro AddESDHandler\n  // no gROOT->LoadMacro for ROOT6\n  AddESDHandler();\n\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask *test = AddTaskPhysicsSelection(kTRUE);\n\n  mgr->InitAnalysis();\n  mgr->PrintStatus();\n}\n\nIn particular when passing arguments to the macro (in the example above passing\nkTRUE to AddTaskPhysicsSelection) this method is very convenient. This method\nis specific to ROOT6. The part including macros has to be protected (see\nbelow).\n\n\nDo I need to include header files in my macros?\nROOT6 comes with a technique called pre-compiled header files. Header files\nfrom a certain library are compiled to a binary format by rootcling, the\nsuccessor of rootcint, and loaded into ROOT6 by an auto-loading mechanism\nsimilar to the rootmap mechanism. Once rootcling is invoked with the\nargument -rml name a .pcm-file is created containing the pre-compiled\nheaders. ROOT6 will search for .pcm-files in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nThe following packages in ALICE provide .pcm support:\n\nAliRoot\nAliPhysics\nRooUnfold\nFairRoot\no2\n\nFor libraries providing .pcm-support NO headers should be included in macros.\nFor libraries handled by the user make sure to\n\nrun rootcling with the arguments -rmf for the .rootmap file\nand -rml for the .pcm file\nInstall both the .rootmap and the .pcm file of your library path in the \nlibrary location (usually PROJECT_PATH/lib)\n\nI get a huge amount of errors, and my macro doesn't run. What can I do?\nHere are few examples that commonly appear in user macros and which are tolerated by ROOT5 but not anymore by ROOT6:\n\nUndefined symbols:\nMaybe you have something like this in your code:\ntaskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThe variable taskname was not defined before. It was implicitly defined in ROOT5 as const char *. In ROOT6 this leads to the error\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'taskname'\nThe variable taskname must be defined with a type before a value can be assigned. In this case the proper code would be\nconst char *taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThanks to C++11 ROOT6 can also detect the type implicitly using the keyword\nauto. In this case the code looks the following:\nauto taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThis will however not be transparent to ROOT5 as ROOT5 doesn't understand\nC++11.\nNote: On the command line ROOT6 automatically adds the auto keyword. The \nstatement above will be possible in the interpreted mode of ROOT6.\n\nMissing forward declarations\nConsider this macro:\nvoid fail_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nUnder ROOT5 this macro will run, but under ROOT6 it will raise the following compiler error:\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'test'\nThe function test is defined, but after it is used. In ROOT5 this is\nno problem: During interpretation the interpreter loads all functions. But\nunder ROOT6 the macro is compiled, and now the order matters: Functions need\nto be declared before they are used. Adding a forward declaration is \nsufficient in order to make the macro working. The following version of\nthe macro will run also under ROOT6:\nint test(int a, int b);\n\nvoid run_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nHandling of pointer and objects:\nROOT5 does not enforce using the proper access operator for objects, pointers and\nreferences, but will allow the usage of the operator -> for\nreferences and the operator . for pointers. ROOT6 distinguishes\nbetween them, and consequently the proper access operator needs to be used.\nConsider the following macro:\nvoid fail_access(){\n  TH1F *ptr = new TH1F(\"ptr\", \"ptr\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  ptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n\n  TH1F obj(\"obj\", \"obj\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj.GetTitle());\n}\n\nConsequently the wrong access operator is used. ROOT5 will warn about the\nincorrect access operator, but it will run the macro. Trying this under ROOT6\nends in the following errors:\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\nptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  ~~~^\n     ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^\n                             ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  ~~~^~\n     .\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj->GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^~\n                             .\n\n\nI get a huge amount of unknown symbols from classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics? Do I still need to include header files?\nIn case the compilation of a macro under ROOT6 fails libraries and pre-compiled\nheaders from external packages are not loaded. The consequence is that ROOT6\ndoes not know about these classes and will raise errors about unknown symbols.\nOnce all the initial compiler errors are fixed (usually at the very top of\nthe error log), the next time the macros are compiled ROOT6 will also load the\nlibraries and .pch files from external libraries and the errors disappear. Header\nfrom ALICE libraries should NOT be included.\nHow do I distinguish between ROOT5 and ROOT6 in my macros?\nSometimes macros require different treatment for ROOT5 and ROOT6. It is then\nnecessary to know which ROOT version is used while the macro is running.\nROOT5 defines the preprocessor macro __CINT__, which can be used to check\nwhether one is in an interpreter session. In current (up to at least v6-12-04)\nhowever also ROOT6 exports __CINT__, so this macro cannot be used to\ndistinguish between ROOT versions.\nROOT6 in addition __CLING__ which is not present in ROOT5. The following lines \nindicate how to run ROOT5/ROOT6 specific code:\n#if defined(__CLING__)\n  // ROOT6-specific code here ...\n#elif defined(__CINT__)\n  // ROOT5-specific code here ...\n#endif\n\nI heard TF1 has changed fundamentally. Is there something to be aware of?\nTF1 is based on TFormula for the formula representation. TFormula got a heavy\nchange: In ROOT5 formulas were always interpreted on-the-fly. With ROOT6 they\nare compiled by the just-in-time compiler. While this leads to a significant\nspeedup in particular when the formula is evaluated multiple times (in fit\nprocedures for example) it comes on cost of breaking backward compatibility, for\nwhich reading TFormula/TF1 object created with ROOT6 with ROOT5 will lead to\nerrors. For what concerns TFormala a ROOT5-compatible version has been added to\nROOT6 as ROOT::v5::TFormula, however something similar does not exist for\nTF1. In order to read a TF1 object from a ROOT file under ROOT5 it has to be\ncreated under ROOT5.\nNow my macro finally works under ROOT6. Will it still work under ROOT5?\nIt depends whether the macro now contains something which ROOT5 does NOT\nunderstand.\n\nROOT6 is fully compatible with C++11. In ROOT5 C++11 support is not\nimplemented, but the standard C++98 is used. C++11-specific code will not\nbe understood.\nAll NEW features provided by ROOT6 are of course not ported to ROOT5.\nThis in particular affects:\nTTreeReader\nTProcPool\nTDataFrame\n...\n\n\nStandard library support in ROOT5, while it comes out-if-the-box in ROOT6.\nIf the macro should run under both ROOT versions consider ROOT containers\ninstead.\nIf your classes write stl-containers containing ROOT-objects to a ROOT-file \nthey must be declared to ROOT5 in your LinkDef.h file. Example:#pragma link C++ class std::vector+;\n\nFor ROOT6 this is not necessary.\n\n\n\n"},"analysis/vectorization.html":{"url":"analysis/vectorization.html","title":"Part 6 - Vectorization","keywords":"","body":"vectorization\n"},"analysis/declarative.html":{"url":"analysis/declarative.html","title":"Part 7 - Declarative analysis","keywords":"","body":"declarative\n"},"analysis/python/":{"url":"analysis/python/","title":"Part 8 - Python","keywords":"","body":"An introduction to Python\nPython is a programming language.

This means that code that works \nwhen run with version 2 of Python may not necessarily work when run with \nversion 3.

The \nanswer is the dot operator ..\n>>> math.sin\n\n\nOperators are special pieces of the syntax of a programming language.\nSyntax is the way you express what you want to do.\nIn Python, an operator acts on the thing that’s on the right of it using the \nthing on the left. In the example we just saw, the dot operator . acts on \nmath in a way that, somehow, retrieves a method called math.sin. We can \nthen use that method straight away:\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(math.pi)\n1.2246467991473532e-16\n\nHere we see there’s also a property of math called pi, which seems to \nhave the appropriate value.\nWe could also store the result of math.sin in a variable, and use it later.\n>>> twopi = 2*math.pi\n>>> my_sin = math.sin\n>>> my_sin(twopi)\n-2.4492935982947064e-16\n\nThere are several symbols that can be used as operators, like +, -, *, \nand /. Certain things support the use of certain operators. For example, \nnumbers support the plus operator:\n>>> 1 + 2\n3\n\nThe plus operator acts on 1 with 2, and, somehow, 1 knows how to deal \nwith 2, in this case by performing addition as we know it.\nWhen we do 1 + 2, what’s going on behind the scenes is exactly the same as \nwhen do math.sin. Observe!\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__add__(2)\n3\n\nNumbers have a special __add__ method attached to them, in the same way \nthat math has a sin method attached. The plus operator + is just a \nshortcut for accessing this __add__ method. The double underscores either \nside of the name tell you that there’s something special about it; in this case \nit means that you can use the plus operator + instead.\n Methods for other operatorsThe other operators that you can use with numbers have corresponding methods. \nWhat other operator methods are available? Try some of them out, and see how \nthey compare with using the operator like normal.\n SolutionClick to expandWe’ve already met two ways that you can find out what things are attached to \nsomething. In IPython, you can try (1).__, or you can always use the \ndir method.\n>>> dir(1)\n['__abs__',\n '__add__',\n '__and__',\n '__bool__',\n ...\n 'to_bytes']\n\nThen it’s just a case of scanning through this list and seeing what names look \nright. The __sub__ name looks like ‘subtraction’, and similarly __mul__ and \n__truediv__ sound like multiplication and division.\n>>> (1).__mul__(5)\n5\n>>> (1).__truediv__(5)\n0.2\n\n\nOf course, there’s also a method for the dot operator! It’s called \n__getattribute__, and it takes the name of the thing you want to get.\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')\n\n\nSo, of course, we can do this horrible one-liner:\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')(3)\n4\n\nYou would never do something like this in your day-to-day programming, but \nwe’ve done it here to illustrate how Python performs operations.\nObjects\nThe use of the dot operator is interesting because we’re manipulating the \nfundamental building block of Python: objects. Objects are containers of \nthings, and we can access those things by name using the dot operator.\nWe can sometimes use other operators as a shorthand for accessing \nspecially-named methods within objects, like using + for __add__.\nMost things in Python are objects! Numbers, like we’ve seen, are objects, \nbecause we can retrieve things from them with ..  Of course, the object \nitself is interesting because it can represent a value, like the number \n999.\nIt the next set of lessons, we’ll go through the different types of objects \nthat come with the Python language.\n"},"analysis/python/numbers.html":{"url":"analysis/python/numbers.html","title":"Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Numbers\nThere’s nothing magical about numbers in Python, and we’ve already discovered \nhow we perform operations on them.\n>>> (2*(1 + 3) - 5)/0.5\n2\n>>> 11 % 4\n3\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that Python has a few different types of \nnumbers, and they can behave differently.\n>>> 10/3\n3\n>>> 10.0/3.0\n3.3333333333333335\n\nInteresting. Something different happens when we use numbers with and without \ndecimal places! This occurs because numbers given with decimal places, like \n3.14  are floats, while those without, like 3, are integers.\nFor historical reasons, dividing two integers in Python 2 returns an integer, \nwhere the intermediate result is always rounded down. Division using at least \none float gives us the more intuitive answer.\nIn Python 3, division with integers works the same way as with floats. You can \nask to have this behaviour in Python 2.\n>>> from __future__ import division\n>>> 3/4\n0.75\n>>> 3.0/4.0\n0.75\n\nBecause the default behaviour in Python 2 is quite unintuitive, we recommend \nusing the from __future__ import division line everywhere. We’ll come to what exactly this \nline is doing shortly.\nIf you do want a rounding division, you then can ask for it explicitly with \nthe // operation:\n>>> 10/3\n3.3333333333333335\n\n>>> 10//3\n3\n\n OperatorsThis behaviour can be explained in terms of operators and the double-underscore \nmethods. You can see that numbers have two methods for division:\n>>> dir(1)\n[...,\n '__floordiv__',\n ...\n '__truediv__',\n ...]\n\nIn Python 2, the / operator corresponded to the __floordiv__ method when \nused with integers, but the __truediv__ operator when used with floats. In \nPython 3, and when using the from __future__ import division line, the / \noperator always uses the __truediv__ method.\n\nPython also lets you manipulate complex numbers, using j to represent the \ncomplex term.\n>>> a = 1 + 4j\n>>> b= 4 - 1j\n>>> a - b\n(-3+5j)\n\nComplex numbers are objects, of course, and have some useful functions and \nproperties attached to them.\n>>> a.conjugate()\n(1-4j)\n>>> a.imag\n4.0\n>>> a.real\n1.0\n\nSomewhat confusingly, computing the magnitude of a complex number can be done \nwith the abs method, which is available globally.\n>>> abs(a)\n4.123105625617661\n>>> import math\n>>> math.sqrt(a.real**2 + a.imag**2)\n4.123105625617661\n\nThis also demonstrates the ** operator, which for real numbers corresponds to \nexponentiation.\nEach type of number can be created literally, like we’ve been doing, by just \ntyping the number into your shell or source code, and by using the correspond \nmethods.\n>>> int()\n0\n>>> float()\n0.0\n>>> complex()\n0j\n\n"},"analysis/python/strings.html":{"url":"analysis/python/strings.html","title":"Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nNumber objects are useful for storing values which are, well, numbers.

This is useful because we can copy-paste the \nstring into some Python code to use it somewhere else, without having to worry \nabout escaping things.\nWe can create multi-line strings by using three quotation marks. \nConventionally, double quotations are usually used for these.\n>>> long_fact = \"\"\"This is a long string.\n...\n...

Strings are said to be \nimmutable for this reason: you can never change a string, just make new ones.\nFormatting\nOne of the most common things you’ll find yourself doing with strings is \ninterleaving values into them. For example, you’ve finished an amazing \nanalysis, and want to print the results.\n>>> result1 = 123.0\n>>> result2 = 122.3\n>>> print 'My results are: ' + str(result1) + ', ' + str(result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nThis is already quite ugly, and will only get worse with more results. We can \ninstead use the format method that’s available on strings, and use the \nspecial {} placeholders to say where we want the values to go in the string.\n>>> template = 'My results are: {0}, {1}'\n>>> print template.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nMuch better! We define the whole string at once, and then place the missing \nvalues in later.\nThe numbers inside the placeholders, {0} and {1}, correspond to the indices \nof the arguments passed to the format method, where 0 is the first \nargument, 1 is the second, and so on. By referencing positions like this, we \ncan easily repeat placeholders in the string, but only pass the values once to \nformat.\n>>> template2 = 'My results are: {0}, {1}. But the best is {0}, obviously.'\n>>> print template2.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nYou can also use named placeholders, then passing the values to format \nusing the same name.\n>>> template3 = 'My results are: {best}, {worst}. But the best is {best}, obviously.'\n>>> print template3.format(best=result1, worst=result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nThis is nice because it gives more meaning to what the placeholders are for.\nThere’s a lot you can do inside the placeholders, such as specifying that you want to format a number with a certain number of decimal places.\n>>> print 'This number is great: {0:.3f}'.format(result1)\nThis number is great: 123.000\n\nIf you want to print a literal curly brace using format, you will need to\nescape it by doubling it, so that {{ will become { and }} will become }.\nHere's an example:\n>>> print 'This number will be surrounded by curly braces: {{{0}}}'.format(123)\nThis number will be surrounded by curly braces: {123}\n\nThe innermost {0} is replaced with the number, and {{...}} becomes {...}.\n"},"analysis/python/lists.html":{"url":"analysis/python/lists.html","title":"Lists and looping","keywords":"","body":"Lists and looping\nNow things start to get really interesting!

If we want to insert\nthe number 6 between the 2 and the 78 in the list above, we would use:\n>>> b[2:0] = [6]\n>>> b\n[99, 2, 6, 78, 45]\n\nmeaning take out 0 elements from the list starting a position 2 and insert the\ncontent of the list [6] in that position.\n Copying a listSlicing creates a copy, so what notation could you use to copy the full list?\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to slice from the very beginning to the very end of the list.\n>>> a[:]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nThis is equivalent to specifying the indices explicitly.\n>>> a[0:len(a)]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\n\nLooping\nWhen you’ve got a collection of things, it’s pretty common to want to access \neach one sequentially. This is called looping, or iterating, and is super easy.\n>>> for item in a:\n...     print item\n...\n4\n2\n9\n45\n\nWe have to indent the code inside the for loop to tell Python that these\nlines should be run for every iteration.\n Indentation in PythonThe for loop is a block, and every Python block requires indentation, unlike\nother \"free-form\" languages such as C++ or Java. This means that Python will\nthrow an error if you don't indent:\n>>> for i in b:\n... print i\n  File \"\", line 2\n    print i\n        ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n\nIndentation must be consistent within the same block, so if you indent two lines\nin the same for loop using a different number of spaces, Python will complain\nonce again:\n>>> for i in b:\n...   print \"I am in a loop\"\n...     print i\n  File \"\", line 3\n    print i\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\nIndentation is necessary as Python does not use any keyword or symbol to\ndetermine the end of a block (e.g. there is no endfor). As a side effect,\nindentation forces you to make your code more readable!\nNote that it does not matter how many spaces you use for indentation. As a\nconvention, we are using four spaces.\n\nThe variable name item can be whatever we want, but its value is changed by \nPython to be the element of the item we’re currently on, starting from the \nfirst.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can try to modify the length of the list whilst \nwe’re iterating.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     del a_copy[0]\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[9, 45]\n\nIntuitively, you might expect a_copy to be empty, but it’s not! The technical\nreasons aren’t important, but this highlights an important rule: never\nmodify the length of a list whilst iterating over it! You won’t end up with\nwhat you expect.\nYou can, however, freely modify the values of each item in the list whilst \nlooping. This is a very common use case.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> i = 0\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     a_copy[i] = 2*item\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nKeeping track of the current index ourselves, with i is annoying, but luckily \nPython gives us a nicer way of doing that.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n...\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Firstly, note that Python lets you assign values \nto multiple variables at the same time.\n>>> one, two = [34, 43]\n>>> print two, one\n43 34\n\nThat’s already pretty cool! But then think about what happens if you had a list \nwhere each item was another list, each containing two numbers.\n>>> nested = [[20, 29], [30, 34]]\n>>> for item in nested:\n...     print item\n...\n[20, 29]\n[30, 34]\n\nSo, we can just assign each item in the sublist to separate variables in the \nfor statement.\n>>> for one, two in nested:\n...     print two, one\n...\n29 20\n34 30\n\nNow we can understand a little better what enumerate does: for each item in \nthe list, it returns a new list containing the current index and the item.\n>>> enumerate(a)\n\n>>> list(enumerate(a))\n[(0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 9), (3, 45)]\n\nFor performance reasons enumerate doesn’t return a list directly, but instead\nsomething that the for statement knows how to iterate over (this is called a\ngenerator and for the moment you\ndon't need to know how it works). We can convert it to a list with the list\nmethod when we want to see what’s it doing.\nThis technique of looping over lists of lists lets us loop over two lists \nsimultaneously, using the zip method.\n>>> for item, item2 in zip(a, a_doubled):\n...     print item2, item\n...\n8 4\n4 2\n18 9\n90 45\n\nNeat! As before, we can see what zip is doing explicitly by using list.\n>>> list(zip(a, a_doubled))\n[(4, 8), (2, 4), (9, 18), (45, 90)]\n\nYou can see that the structure of the list that’s iterated over, the output of \nzip, is identical to that for enumerate.\nFinally, we’ll take a quick look at the range method.\n>>> range(0, 10)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nThe arguments to range work just like slicing, the second argument is treated \nexclusively, as its value is excluded from the output. Again like slicing, we \ncan specify a third argument as the step size for the iteration.\n>>> range(0, 10, 2)\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nIf you only give a single argument to range, it assumes you’ve given the end \nvalue, and want a starting value of zero.\n>>> range(5)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nThis reads “give me a list of length 5, in steps of 1, starting from zero”.\nNow that we know how to easily generate sequences of numbers, we can write \nenumerate by hand!\n>>> for index, item in zip(range(len(a)), a):\n...     print index, item\n...\n0 4\n1 2\n2 9\n3 45\n\nJust like before! When you see something cool like enumerate, it can be fun \ntrying to see how you’d accomplish something similar with different building \nblocks.\nList comprehension\nWe’ve already made a new list from an existing one when we created a_doubled.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n\nCreating a new list from an existing one is a common operation, so Python has a \nshorthand syntax called list comprehension.\n>>> a_doubled = [2*item for item in a]\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nIsn’t that beautiful?\nWe can use the same multi-variable stuff we learnt whilst looping.\n>>> [index*item for index, item in enumerate(a)]\n[0, 2, 18, 135]\n\nWe’re not restricted to creating new lists with the same structure as the \noriginal.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4], [9, 81], [45, 2025]]\n\nWe can even filter out items from the original list using if.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a if item % 2 == 0]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4]]\n\nList comprehensions are a powerful way of succinctly creating new lists. But be \nresponsible; if you find you’re doing something complicated, it’s probably \nbetter to write a full for loop.\nTuples\nA close relative of lists are tuples, which differ in that they cannot be \nmutated after creation.  You can create tuples literally using parentheses, or \nconvert things to tuples using the tuple method.\n>>> a = (3, 4)\n>>> del a[0]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion\n>>> a.append(5)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\n>>> a[0] = 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n>>> b = tuple([65, 'yes'])\n>>> b\n(65, 'yes')\n\nTuples are usually used to describe data whose length is meaningful in and of \nitself. For example, you could express coordinates as a tuple.\n>>> coords = (3.2, 0.1)\n>>> x, y = coords\n\nThis is nice because it doesn’t make sense to append to an (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) \ncoordinate, nor to ‘delete’ a dimension. Generally, it can be useful if the \ndata structure you’re using respects the meaning of the data you’re storing.\nIf you can’t think of a use for tuples yourself, its worth keeping in mind that \nPython creates tuples for groups of things by default. We saw that \nearlier when we used enumerate.\n>>> list(enumerate([4, 9]))\n[(0, 4), (1, 9)]\n\nEach element of the list is a tuple.\n Write a list comprehension yourselfCompute the square of the magnitude of the sum of the following two \nthree-vectors, using a single list comprehension and the global sum method.\n>>> kaon = [3.4, 4.3, 20.0]\n>>> pion = [1.4, 0.9, 19.8]\n\nIt might help to first think about how you’d compute the quantity for a single \nvector.\n SolutionClick to expandNot sure what the sum method does? Ask for help!\n>>> help(sum)\n\nThe square magnitude is the sum of the squares of the components, where the \ncomponents are the sum of the two input vectors.\n>>> magsq = sum([(k + pi)**2 for k, pi in zip(kaon, pion)])\n\nThe square root of this is around 40.42.\n\n"},"analysis/python/dictionaries.html":{"url":"analysis/python/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nYou can think of lists as a mapping from indices to values. The indices are\nalways integers and go from 0 to len(the_list), and the values are the\nitems.\nDictionaries are collections, just like lists, but they have important\ndifferences:\n\nlists map sequential numeric indices to items, whereas dictionaries can map\nmost object types to any object,\nlists are ordered collections of items, whereas dictionaries have no\nordering.\n\nSince anything can be used as index for an item, indices must be always\nspecified when creating a dictionary:\n>>> d = {1: 0.5, 'excellent index': math.sin, 0.1: 2}\n>>> d[1]\n0.5\n>>> d['excellent index']\n\n>>> d[0.1] = 3\n\nThe \"indices\" of a dictionary are called keys, and the things they map to\nare values. Together, each key-value pair is an item.\n>>> d.keys()\n[1, 0.1, 'excellent index']\n>>> d.values()\n[0.5, 2, ]\n>>> d\n{0.1: 2, 1: 0.5, 'excellent index': }\n\nAs you can see, the values of a dictionary can be whatever we like, and need not\nbe the same type of object.\nYou can see that the order of the keys, values and items we get back are not the\nsame as the order we created the dictionary with. If you run the same example on\nyour own you might get a different ordering. This is what we mean when we define\ndictionaries as unordered collections: when you iterate over its content, you\ncannot rely on the ordering.\nIt is however guaranteed that the n-th item returned by keys() corresponds\nto the n-th item returned by values(). This allows the following example\nto work flawlessly:\n>>> for key, value in zip(d.keys(), d.values()):\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nOf course, this could be considerably simpler just by using items(), which\ngives us tuples of key-value pairs.\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe can create dictionaries from lists of 2-item lists.\n>>> dict(enumerate(['a thing', 'another']))\n{0: 'a thing', 1: 'another'}\n\nAnd also with dictionary comprehensions, in a similar manner to list\ncomprehensions, with the additional specification of the key.\n>>> {i: i**i for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 4, 4: 256, 5: 3125}\n\nNote that dictionary comprehensions require at least Python 2.7 to work.\nDictionary keys\nThere’s no restriction on values a dictionary might hold, but there is on keys.\n>>> l = [1, 4, 3]\n>>> dd = {}\n>>> dd[l] = 0\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\nIn essence, keys must not be mutable. This includes numbers, strings, and\ntuples, but not lists. This restriction is a trade-off that allows Python to\nmake accessing values in a dictionary by key very fast.\n HashingImmutable data types in Python have a __hash__() function, you can test it\nyourself:\n>>> s = \"a string\"\n>>> s.__hash__()\n-8411828025894108412\n\nA hashing function creates an\nencoded (but not unique) representation of the object as a number. When you\nlook up an item in a Python dictionary with my_dict[\"my_key\"], what happens\ninternally is:\n\nhash of \"my_key\" is calculated,\nthis number is compared to every hash of every key in the dictionary, until a\nmatch between the hashes is found,\nif two hashes match, and the two objects are really identical, the\ncorresponding dictionary item is returned.\n\nLooking up numbers instead of strings or tuples is considerably faster, but\nsince two different strings can have the same hash, their content has to be\ncompared as well to really tell whether they are equal. If two hashes are\ndifferent on the other hand we are sure that the objects are different as well.\n\nIteration over dictionaries is over their keys.\n>>> for key in d:\n...     print key, ':' d[key]\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe have already seen how to iterate over values (using d.values()) or keys\nand values simultaneously (using d.items()).\n On the efficiency of items()In Python 2, using items copies the keys and values of a dictionary, and gives\nyou back those copies. This can be problematic for large dictionaries as the\namount of memory your program uses can double. Python 3 uses a much more\nmemory-efficient way of implementing items so that you don't have to worry.\nIf you're having memory problems with using items in Python 2, you can use\nviewitems() instead, which behaves the same way as items does in Python 3.\nNote that there are also similar methods for keys and values, called\nviewkeys() and viewvalues(), and that all of these view methods are only\navailable from\nPython 2.7.\n\n Alphabet mappingMap each letter of the alphabet to a number with a dictionary comprehension,\nstarting with 0 for a and ending with 25 for z.\nYou can get a string containing the letters of the alphabet like this:\n>>> import string\n>>> string.ascii_lowercase\n'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nYou can iterate over a string exactly like a list.\n>>> for character in string.ascii_lowercase:\n...     print character\n...\na\nb\n...\nz\n\nThen, create the \"reverse\" dictionary, again with a comprehension, mapping\nletters to numbers.\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to have a list containing one number per letter, and to loop over that\nlist along with the characters in the string. This is exactly the same as\nlooping over items in a list alongside the index, so we can use enumerate.\n>>> alphabet_map = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase)}\n\nWe can create the inverse map by swapping the key and value in the\ncomprehension.\n>>> reverse_map = {c: i for i, c in alphabet_map.items()}\n\n\n"},"analysis/python/conditions.html":{"url":"analysis/python/conditions.html","title":"Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Conditions\nSometimes, often while looping, you only want to do things depending on\nsomething’s value.

If this also isn’t met, the else block is run. You can use as many\nelif conditions as you like, or none at all, and the else block is optional.\n Ternary conditional operatorYou can use a succinct one-line syntax for conditional assignments like this:\n>>> x = 'ok' if pizzas[0] == 'Cheese' else 'not ok'\n>>> x\n'not ok'\n\nMake sure your line does not get too long in order not to impair its\nreadability!\n\nPython evaluates a condition and sees whether it is truth-like or not.

You can even mix positional arguments with\nkeyword arguments, but any keyword arguments must come last.\nUsing keyword arguments is particularly useful for arguments which act as\non/off flags, because it’s often not obvious what your True or False is\ndoing.\n>>> def add(x, y, show):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, True) # Hmm, what is True doing again?\n3\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True) # Aha! Much clearer\n\nAlways having to specify that flag is annoying. It would be much nicer if\nshow had a default value, so that we don’t have to provide a value when\ncalling the method, but can optionally override it.\n>>> def add(x, y, show=False):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2) # No printing!\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True)\n3\n\nPerfect.\nOf course, function arguments can be anything, even other functions!\n>>> def run_method(method, x):\n...     \"\"\"Call `method` with `x`.\"\"\"\n...     return method(x)\n...\n>>> run_method(len, [1, 2, 3])\n3\n\n Methods returning methodsWhat does this method do?\n>>> def make_incrementor(increment):\n...     def func(var):\n...         return var + increment\n...     return func\n\n SolutionClick to expandIt returns a function whose increment value has been filled by the argument\nto make_incrementor. If we called make_incrementor(3), then increment has\nthe value 3, and we can fill in the returned method in our heads.\ndef func(var):\n    return var + 3\n\nSo when we call this method, we’ll get back what we put in, but plus 3.\n>>> increment_one = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> increment_two = make_incrementator(2)\n>>> print increment_one(42), increment_two(42)\n43 44\n>>> print make_incrementator(3)(42) # Do it in one go!\n45\n\n\nWhat if you like to accept an arbitrary number of arguments? For example, we\ncan also write a total method that takes two arguments.\n>>> def total(x, y):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return x + y\n...\n>>>\n\nBut what if we want to allow the caller to pass more than two arguments? It\nwould be tedious to define many arguments explicitly.\n>>> def total(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `*` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(args), args)\n...     return sum(args)\n...\n>>> total(1)\nGot 1 arguments: (1,)\n1\n>>> total(1, 2)\nGot 2 arguments: (1, 2)\n3\n>>> total(1, 2, 3)\nGot 3 arguments: (1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nThe *args syntax says “stuff any arguments into a tuple and call it args”.\nThis let’s us capture any number of arguments. As args is a tuple, one could\nloop over it, access a specific element, and so on.\nWe can also expand lists into separate arguments with the same syntax when\ncalling a method.\n>>> def reverse_args(x, y):\n...     return y, x\n...\n>>> l = ['a', 'b']\n>>> reverse_args(l)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: reverse_args() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)\n>>> reverse_args(*l)\n('b', 'a')\n\nA similar syntax exists for keyword arguments.\n>>> def ages(**people):\n...     \"\"\"Print people's information.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `**` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(people), people)\n...     for person in people:\n...         print 'Person {0} is {1}'.format(person, people[person])\n...\n>>> ages(steve=31)\nGot 1 arguments: {'steve': 31}\nPerson steve is 31\n>>> ages(steve=31, helen=70, zorblax=9963)\nGot 3 arguments: {'steve': 31, 'zorblax': 9963, 'helen': 70}\nPerson steve is 31\nPerson zorblax is 9963\nPerson helen is 70\n\nAs you can see from the debug print statement, **people is a dictionary\ncontaining the keyword arguments we passed to the ages method. The keys of\nthe dictionary are the names of the argument as strings, and the values are the\nvalues of the arguments. Just like for the * syntax, ** can also be used to\nexpand a dictionary into keyword arguments.\n>>> d = {'thor': 5000, 'yoda': -1}\n>>> ages(**d)\nGot 2 arguments: {'yoda': -1, 'thor': 5000}\nPerson yoda is -1\nPerson thor is 5000\n\nThe order of the keyword arguments used to call the method are not necessarily\nthe same as those that the function block sees!\nThis is because dictionaries are unordered, and the ** syntax effectively creates a dictionary.\n The most generic methodThe most generic method would take any number of positional arguments and any\nnumber of keyword arguments. What would this method look like?\n SolutionClick to expandIt would use both * and ** syntax in defining the arguments.\n>>> def generic(*args, **kwargs):\n...     print 'Got args: {0}'.format(args)\n...     print 'Got kwargs: {0}'.format(kwargs)\n...\n>>> d = {'bing': 'baz'}\n>>> generic(1, 2, 'abc', foo='bar', **d)\nGot args: (1, 2, 'abc')\nGot kwargs: {'bing': 'baz', 'foo': 'bar'}\n\n\nInline methods\nSome methods take other methods as arguments, like the built-in map method.\n>>> map(str, range(5))\n['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']\n\nmap takes a function and an iterable, and applies the function to each element in\nthe iterable. It returns a new list with the results. We can define and then pass\nour own functions.\n>>> def cube(x):\n...     \"\"\"Return the third power of x.\"\"\"\n...     return x*x*x\n...\n>>> map(cube, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nFor such a simple method, this is a lot of typing! We can use a lambda function to\ndefine such simple methods inline.\n>>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nThe syntax of defining a lambda is like this:\nlambda : \n is a command-separate set of variables that the lambda can take as\narguments, and  is the code that is run. A lambda\nautomatically returns whatever the result of the expression is, you don’t need\na return (the return is implicit).\nWriting a lambda statement defines a method, which you can capture as a\nvariable just like any other object.\n>>> div2 = lambda x: x/2\n>>> div2\n at 0x7fc6b2207758>\n>>> map(div2, range(5))\n[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n\nNote that we got real numbers back because we are using Python 2 with from __future__ import division.\n Sum in quadratureWrite a method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, and returns the\nsum of the arguments computed in quadrature. A “sum in quadrature” is the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of each number. You should use lambda\nto define a squaring and a square root function, and map to apply the\nsquaring method.\n SolutionClick to expandWe need a little square root method and a method to square its input.\n>>> square = lambda x: x*x\n>>> sqrt = lambda x: x**0.5\n\nWe then define a method that can accept any number of arguments using the\n*args syntax, and use map to call the square method on the list of\narguments. Then we can call sum on the result, and then sqrt.\n>>> def quadrature(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum in quadrature of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return sqrt(sum(map(square, args)))\n...\n>>> quadrature(1, 1) # should be equal to sqrt(2)\n1.4142135623730951\n>>> 2**0.5\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nAnother use case for lambda is the built-in filter method (see:\nhelp(filter)).\n>>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))   # filter and return the even numbers only\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n List comprehensionHow would you rewrite the filter example above using a list comprehension?\n SolutionClick to expand>>> [ x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 ]\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\nGenerally, you should only use lambda methods to define little throw-away\nmethods. The main downside with using them is that you can’t attach a docstring\nto them, and they become unwieldy when there’s complex logic.\n"},"analysis/python/scripting.html":{"url":"analysis/python/scripting.html","title":"Scripting","keywords":"","body":"Scripting\nOK, so we’ve spent quite a long time in Python shells.

To add this, we use for example the sys module, which makes the command line\narguments available as the argv property. We can modify our script to print\nthis out, to get a feeling for what’s going on. We’ll comment out our method\ncall whilst we’re just playing around.\nimport sys\nimport time\n\ndef make_pizza(*toppings):\n    \"\"\"Make a delicious pizza from the toppings.\"\"\"\n    print 'Making pizza...'\n    for topping in toppings:\n        print 'Adding {0}'.format(topping)\n        time.sleep(1)\n    print 'Done!'\n    return 'Pizza with toppings: {0}'.format(toppings)\n\nprint 'sys.argv:', sys.argv\n# pizza = make_pizza('cheese', 'olives')\n\nThen run it:\n$ python pizzaiolo.py\nsys.argv: ['pizzaiolo.py']\n$ python pizzaiolo.py cheese broccoli\nsys.argv: ['pizzaiolo.py', 'cheese', 'broccoli']\n$ python pizzaiolo.py cheese broccoli --help --verbose\nsys.argv: ['pizzaiolo.py', 'cheese', 'broccoli', '--help', '--verbose']\n\nAwesome! sys.argv is just a list with one value per argument (arguments on\nthe command line are separate by spaces).

Actually, that is pretty much all there is to\nthem.\nUsing modules into your code: import\nThe keyword import, usually specified at the beginning of your source code, is\nused to tell Python what modules you want to make available to your current\ncode.\nThere are different ways of specifying an import. The one we have seen already\nsimply makes the module available to you:\n>>> import random\n>>> random.uniform(0, 1)\n0.5877109428927353\n\nThe module random contains functions useful for random number generation: with\nthe import above, we have made the random module accessible, and everything\nwithin that module is accessible via the syntax random.. For the record,\nthe uniform(x,y) method returns a pseudo-random number within the range\n[x,y][x,y][x,y].\nSometimes you want to make only one or more things from a given module\naccessible: Python gives you the ability to import just those:\n>>> from random import uniform, choice\n>>> uniform(0, 1)\n0.4059007502204043\n>>> choice([ 33, 56, 42, -1 ])\n42\n\nIn this case the uniform and choice names are available directly, i.e.\nwithout using the random prefix. All other functions in the random module\nare not available in this case. For the record, the choice function returns a\nrandom element from a given collection.\nAnother option is to import all functions of a certain module and make them\navailable without a prefix:\n>>> from random import *\n>>> gauss(0, 1)\n-1.639334770284028\n\nThis is not that recommended as you generally do not know what is the extent\nof what you are importing and you might end up with name clashes between your\ncurrent code and the imported module, as it will all be in the same namespace,\nmeaning directly available with no need for a . syntax. \nLastly, it is possible to import modules, or specific names from a module,\nunder an alias.\n>>> from random import uniform as uni\n>>> uni(0, 1)\n0.7288973406605329\n>>> import numpy as np\nnp.arccos(1)\n0.0\n\nThis option is useful when you need to assign shorter aliases to names you will\nuse frequently. In particular, the alias np for the numpy module will be\nencountered a lot.\nNote that modules can have submodules, specified with extra dots .:\n>>> from os.path import abspath\n>>> abspath('..')\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d'\n\nWhen importing a module, its submodules are not available by default and you\nmust import them explicitly:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.getcwd()\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d/dberzano'\n>>> import os.path\n>>> os.path.basename(os.getcwd())\n'dberzano'\n\nNote that due to the current Python implementation of the os module, os.path\nfunctions are actually available even without importing os.path. But just\nos. You cannot and should not rely on this implementation, which represents an exception\nand might change in the future. Always import submodules explicitly!\nIt is also possible to import several modules with a single import command:\n>>> import os, sys, math\n\nbut this is not recommended by the Python style guide, which\nsuggests to use several import statements, one per module, as it improves\nreadability:\n>>> import os\n>>> import sys\n>>> import math\n\nIf you need to import several names from a single module, you can split an import\nfunction over multiple lines:\n>>> from math import (\n...     exp,\n...     log,\n...     e,\n...     floor\n... )\n>>> floor(exp(log(e)))\n2.0\n\nThe standard library\nThe set of things that Python comes with, from all of the types of objects to\nall of the different modules, is called the standard library. It is\nrecommended to browse through the standard library documentation to see what is\navailable: Python is rich of standard modules, and you should reuse them as much\nas possible instead of rewriting code on your own.\nSome of the categories for which standard modules are available are:\n\nprocessing paths\ndate and time manipulation\nmathematical functions\nparsing of certain file formats\nsupport for multiple processes and threads\n...\n\nUse standard Python library modules with confidence: being part of any standard\nPython distribution, your code will be easily portable.\nModules from PyPi\nMany external modules can be found on PyPi, the Python Package Index repository.\nSome of those modules are\nalready part of some Python distributions (such as Anaconda, which\ncomes with more than a thousand science-oriented modules preinstalled).\nIf a certain module you need is not available on your distribution you can\neasily install it with the pip shell command. Since you typically do not have write\naccess to the standard Python installation's directories, pip allows you to\ninstall modules only for yourself, under your current user's home directory.\nIt is recommended to set up in your shell startup script (such as ~/.bashrc)\nthe following two lines telling once and for all where to install and search for\nPython user modules:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/.local\nexport PATH=$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\n\nOnce you have done that, close your current terminal window and open a new one,\nand you will be ready to use pip. We will see in a later lesson how to install\nthe root_pandas module with:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nWrite your first Python module\nThe simplest Python module you can write is just a .py file with some\nfunctions inside:\n# myfirstmodule.py\n\ndef one():\n    print('this is my first function')\n\ndef two():\n    print('this is my second function')\n\nYou can now fire an ipython shell and use those functions right away:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nBy simply calling the file myfirstmodule.py we have made it available as a\nmodule named myfirstmodule - given that the file is in the same directory\nwhere we have launched the Python interpreter.\n Module name restrictionsNote that you cannot pick any name you want for a module! From the\n[Python style guide][pep8-modulenames], we gather that we should use \"short,\nall-lowercase names\". As a matter of fact, if we used dashes in the file name,\nwe would have ended up with a syntax error while trying to load it:\n>>> import my-first-module\n  File \"\", line 1\n    import my-first-module\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nPython treats - as a minus and does not understand your intentions.\n\nWrite a structured module\nLet's now create a more structured module, with submodules and different files.\nWe can start from the myfirstmodule.py file and create a directory structure:\n$ mkdir yabba\n$ cp myfirstmodule.py yabba/__init__.py\n\nWe have reused the same file created before, copied it into a directory called\nyabba and renamed it to __init__.py. The double underscore should ring a\nbell: this is a Python special name, and it represents the \"main file\" within\na module, whereas the directory name now represents the module name.\nThis means that our module is called yabba, and if we import it, functions\nfrom __init__.py will be available:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> yabba.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> yabba.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nWe can create an additional file inside the yabba directory, say\nyabba/extra.py and have more functions there:\n# yabba/extra.py\n\ndef three():\n  print 'this function will return the number three'\n  return 3\n\nWe have effectively made extra a submodule of yabba. Let's try:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> filter(lambda x: not x.startswith('__'), dir(yabba))\n['one', 'two']\n>>> import yabba.extra\n>>> yabba.extra.three()\nyabba.extra.three()\nthis function will return the number three\n3\n\n What have I done with the filter function?We have used the filter function above to list the functions we have defined\nin our module. Can you describe in detail what the commands above do?\n SolutionClick to expandThe dir(module) command lists all names (not necessarily functions, not\nnecessarily defined by us) contained in a given imported module. We have used the\nfilter() command to filter out all names starting with two underscores. Every\nitem returned by dir() is passed as x to the lambda function which returns\nTrue or False, determining whether the filter() function should keep or\ndiscard the current element.\n\nRun a module\nWe can make a Python module that can be easily imported by other Python\nprograms, but we can also make it in a way that it can be run directly as a\nPython script.\nLet's write this special module and call it runnable.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nlong_format = False\n\ndef print_label(label, msg):\n    if long_format:\n        out = '{0}: {1}'.format(label.upper(), str(msg))\n    else:\n        out = '{0}-{1}'.format(label[0].upper(), str(msg))\n    print out\n\ndef debug(msg):\n    print_label('debug', msg)\n\ndef warning(msg):\n    print_label('warning', msg)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print '*** Testing print functions ***'\n    debug('This is a debug message')\n    long_format = True\n    warning('This is a warning message with a long label')\nelse:\n    print 'Module {0} is being imported'.format(__name__)\n\nNow let's make it executable:\n$ chmod +x runnable.py\n\nIt can be now run as a normal executable from your shell:\n$ ./runnable.py\n*** Testing print functions ***\nD-This is a debug message\nWARNING: This is a warning message with a long label\nThere are two outstanding notions here. First off, the first line is a\n\"shebang\": it really has to be the first line in a file (it cannot be the\nsecond, or \"one of the first\", or the first non-empty) and it basically tells\nyour shell that your executable text file has to be interpreted by the current\nPython interpreter. Just use this line as it is.\nSecondly, we notice we have a peculiar if condition with a block that gets\nexecuted when we run the file. __name__ is a special internal Python variable\nwhich is set to the module name in case the module is imported. When the module\nis ran, it is set to the special value \"__main__\".\nThe else: condition we have added is just to show what happens when you import\nthe module instead:\n>>> import runnable\nModule runnable is being imported\n>>> runnable.warning('hey I can use it from here too')\nW-hey I can use it from here too\n\nNow, the if condition is not necessary when you want to run the module - those\nlines in the if block will be executed anyway. It is however used to prevent\nsome lines from being executed when you import the file as a module.\nPlease also note that module imports are typically silent, so the else:\ncondition with a printout would not exist in real life.\n"},"analysis/python/learning.html":{"url":"analysis/python/learning.html","title":"Learning more","keywords":"","body":"Learning more\nLearning Python is like learning… well, like learning a language!

One of the great \nthings about Python is that many people around the world use it, and it’s very \npopular in high energy physics, so you likely already know someone who can help \nsolve your problem. Working on code with others is a great way to learn, as you \ncan see how other people do things, and find out tricks you didn’t know about.\nBeyond other people, Google is a powerful ally. Knowing how to express your \nproblem is important in getting the best answers quickly. Generally, including \na few words as possible is a good idea, like “python dictionary delete \nkey”, or “python read file lines”.\nStack Overflow is an excellent resource, with \ncommunity-provided answers for many programming-related questions. Most \nproblems you encounter will already be answered there, and often the answers \nare quite didactic, providing context and further reading, beyond just posting \nthe code that answers the question (these answers aren’t always the ones marked \nas the ‘best answer’, and don’t always have the most votes).\nExploring Python\nThe Python standard library is a treasure-trove of useful objects and methods. \nWe’ve gone through a tiny subset of them here, some others that might be useful \nto you are:\n\nos: Operating system functions to manipulate and query your machine and the \nfile system, like os.mkdir to make directories and os.rename.\ntempfile: create files and directories in a temporary location, like\n/tmp, e.g. tempfile.mkdtemp.\nglob: File name matching, to be able to do things like ls folder/*.txt in \nPython with glob.glob('folder/*.txt').\nsubprocess: Call shell commands with subprocess.call(['ls', '-l', '-a']).\ntime: Get the current time with time.localtime().tm_hour.\ncollections: Use collections.namedtuple to create your own property-only\nobjects.>>> import collections\n>>> Coordinate = collections.namedtuple('Coordinate', ['x', 'y'])\n>>> coord = Coordinate(4.5, 2.0)\n>>> coord.y\n2.0\n>>> x, y = coord\n>>> x\n4.5\n\nUse collections.OrderedDict for ordered dictionaries.>>> d = {'foo': 'bar', 123: 321, 'hero': 'thor'}\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\n123 321\nfoo bar\nhero thor\n>>> d = collections.OrderedDict([('foo', 'bar'), (123, 321)])\n>>> d.update([('hero', 'thor')])\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\nfoo bar\n123 321\nhero thor\n\ncollections.defaultdict is useful for creating dictionaries that will create \nautomatically create values when a previously undefined key is accessed.>>> d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n>>> d['foo'] += 1\n>>> print d, d['foo'], d['bar']\ndefaultdict(, {'foo': 1}) 1 0\n\n\n\nConventional coding\n‘Pythonic code’ is code that follows the conventions of the wider Python \ncommunity. Lots of people write Python, and by following certain stylistic \nconventions it makes it easier for everyone to read each other’s code (as they \nsay: ‘you spend 90% of your time reading code, and 10% writing it’).\nPythonic style emphasises clean, readable code, with consistent formatting and \nuseful comments. The most important thing is to be consistent. You can consult \nPEP8, the official Python style recommendations, if you're unsure or\nwant to settle a dispute like lower_case_functions versus \nupperCaseFunctions. Which of these two methods is easier to read?\nimport time\n\n\ndef myFunc(x,y,verbose = True, fast='yes'):\n    \"\"\"Do the thing.\"\"\"\n    z=( x *y ) /2\n    if verbose == False:\n        print x,y, z\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep( 1 )\n    return  z* z\n\n\ndef my_func(x, y, verbose=True, fast=True):\n    \"\"\"Return ((x*y)/2)**2.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    x, y -- Values used in the computation\n    verbose -- Print computation information\n    fast -- If True, sleep for 1 second before returning\n    \"\"\"\n    z = (x*y)/2\n\n    if verbose:\n        print x, y, z\n    # Should probably remove this functionality\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n    return z*z\n\nThe Zen of Python summarises the ‘philosophy’ that the language tries to \nfollow. See what you think!\n>>> import this\n\n\n“There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it”\n\nIf there isn't, you might be trying to come at a problem the wrong way.\n"},"analysis/python/first_histogram.html":{"url":"analysis/python/first_histogram.html","title":"Making your first histogram","keywords":"","body":"Making your first histogram\nIn this section we are going to make our first plots using Python. For this we\nwill use some public LHCb data for B+→H+H+H− B^+ \\rightarrow H^+ H^+ H^- B​+​​→H​+​​H​+​​H​−​​ from the\nCERN open data portal. This data is available\non EOS:\n$ eos root://eospublic.cern.ch/ ls /eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data\nB2HHH_MagnetDown.root\nB2HHH_MagnetUp.root\nPhaseSpaceSimulation.root\n\n Installing python packagesOne of the best things about Python is the huge number of packages available,\nfor everything from art to machine learning to web development. While LCG\nprovides a lot of useful packages, there are sometimes things missing.\nFortunately, most packages can be easily installed into ~/.local/ using pip\nwith the --user flag. In this lesson we will be using\nroot_pandas, which can\nbe installed using\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nSome packages, such as flake8, provide executables\nwhich are useful to have included on your PATH so they are available without\nspecifying their absolute path. This can be done by running\nexport PATH=$(python -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH\n\nsee the bash lesson for more details about the PATH variable.\nWe can even upgrade already installed packages using:\npip install --user matplotlib --upgrade\n\nAs LCG uses PYTHONPATH to make packages available, any packages it provides\nhave higher priority than the user installed packages. In order to make it so\nthat a package installed with --user takes precedence, you must run\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(python -m site --user-site):$PYTHONPATH\n\nevery time you run the source command above. This is only needed when\ninstalling user packages to upgrade LCG provided ones.\n\nAll ROOT methods made available in Python using a set of automatically generated\nbindings, known as PyROOT.\nThese are all available by using import ROOT.\nFor example if we want to create a TFile using the aforementioned data we can\nlaunch ipython and run:\nIn [1]: import ROOT\nIn [2]: filename = 'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root'\nIn [3]: my_file = ROOT.TFile.Open(filename)\nIn [4]: my_file.ls()\n\nTNetXNGFile**       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n TNetXNGFile*       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n  KEY: TTree    DecayTree;1 Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays\nIn [5]: my_tree = my_file.Get('DecayTree')\nIn [6]: my_tree.Print()\n******************************************************************************\n*Tree    :DecayTree : Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays          *\n*Entries :  5135823 : Total =       945201357 bytes  File  Size =  666480138 *\n*        :          : Tree compression factor =   1.42                       *\n******************************************************************************\nWhile it is very useful to be able to access all the ROOT functionality in this\nway, they are often slow and tedious to use. Luckily people have built more\nspecialised bindings to allow ROOT to be used in a more pythonic way.\nPandas\npandas is a library for doing data analysis on\ntabular data, using a data structure known as dataframes. These typically have\ncolumns with labels (like TLeafs in a TTree) with many rows. The\nroot_pandas package we installed earlier can be used to create a pandas\nDataFrame from a root file:\nIn [7]: import root_pandas\nIn [8]: df = root_pandas.read_root(filename, key='DecayTree')\n\nWe can then use df.head(5) to see the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:\nIn [9]: df.head(5)\nOut[9]:\n   B_FlightDistance  B_VertexChi2        H1_PX        H1_PY          H1_PZ  \\\n0         25.301004      1.497280   375.284205   831.308481   51820.233718\n1         94.690700      1.383338 -4985.130785  5853.750057  326157.454706\n2          8.284490      5.187101 -1265.456544  2330.050788   90762.658032\n3          5.590769      7.129099  -720.797259  3413.790588   86793.058768\n4          3.013242     10.988701   397.754571  1791.373059   40040.364159\n\nWhile it is nice to be able to view the data, it is typically much more useful to\nbe able to apply operations to it in bulk. In this example we have the momentum\ncomponents for each of the child particles in the decay (H1, H2 and H3)\nbut not the transverse momentum. We can however apply expressions to each row\nof the data like so:\nIn [10]: df.eval('sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)')\nOut [10]: 0          1306.642724\n1           167.578904\n2          1273.457019\n3          1146.299204\n             ...\n5135820     210.430531\n5135821     762.344570\n5135822    1454.471057\ndtype: float64\n\nThis gives us the transverse momentum for each particle as an array, however, we\ncan also create a new column with this information by assigning to the name we\nwant to create and doing the action \"inplace\":\nIn [11]: df.eval('H2_PT = sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)', inplace=True)\n\n Adding the total B+ meson momentumCreate a new column in the dataframe called B_P for the total momentum of the\nB+ meson.\n SolutionClick to expanddf.eval('B_P = sqrt('\n        '(H1_PX + H2_PX + H3_PX)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PY + H2_PY + H3_PY)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PZ + H2_PZ + H3_PZ)**2'\n        ')', inplace=True)\n\n\nPlotting histograms\nNow that we have the momentum of the B+B+B+ meson, it would be useful to plot\nits distribution in a histogram. We could use ROOT for this but the most popular Python library for\nplotting is known as matplotlib and this is what we\nwill use here. The most common way matplotlib is used is with the pyplot\ninterface imported as plt like so:\nIn [12]: import matplotlib\nIn [13]: matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Force matplotlib to not use any Xwindows backend.\nIn [14]: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nIn [15]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'])\nIn [16]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance.pdf')\n\n\n Interactive plottingThere are various ways of viewing plots interactively such as:\n\nplt.show() Opens a window with the current plot and pauses the Python\ninterpreter until the window is closed\nplt.ion() Allows plots to be viewed without pausing the Python interpreter\njupyter A web based interface for running various\nlanguages including python in \"notebooks\". If you've used mathematica or\nmatlab before it's a similar interface with code, documentation and plots\nall shown together.\n\n\nIn [17]: import numpy as np\nIn [18]: bins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\nIn [19]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins)\nIn [20]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v2.pdf')\n\n\nThat's not right! The new histogram has been plotted on top of our first one!\nThis is normally useful as it allows us to layer plots on top of each other to\ncompare them. Though in this case we don't want to do that so we should first close\nthe previous plot before making our histogram. We should also add axis labels\nand a legend like so:\nIn [21]: plt.close()  # Close the previous plot\n\nIn [22]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', label='My data label')\nIn [23]: plt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nIn [24]: plt.xlabel('Flight distance of $B^+$ meson')\nIn [25]: plt.legend(loc='best')\nIn [26]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v3.pdf')\n\n\nApplying cuts\nWhen analysing data it is often useful to \"throw away\" some data in order to in\norder change the contributions of a sample. Most commonly this is to remove some\nbackground(s) so we can more precisely study a process of interest. This is\nknown as cutting.\nIn pandas we can apply a cut to a DataFrame using the query method. For\nexample to make a new DataFrame containing B+B^+B​+​​ mesons with flight distances\nof more than 15 mm we can use:\nIn [27]: df_with_cut = df.query('B_FlightDistance > 15')\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsIt is often useful to compare the effect of a cut on the distribution of another\nvariable. Try to plot a histogram showing the B+ lifetime distribution with and\nwithout a total B+ momentum cut of 100000 MeV.\n SolutionClick to expandbins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\ndf_with_cut = df.query('B_P > 100000')\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='Without cut')\nplt.hist(df_with_cut['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='With 100 GeV momentum cut')\n\nplt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nplt.xlabel('Total momentum of $B^+$ meson')\nplt.legend(loc='best')\nplt.savefig('B_flight_distance_with_cut_compare.pdf')\n\nHere we also use the normed=True option with plt.hist, this plots the\nnormalised distribution. This is typically more useful when comparing\ndistributions as it make it easier to see differences in the shape without the\nindependently of the total number of events.\n\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsCalculate and plot the B+ meson mass assuming that all three of the child\nhadrons are kaons.\n\n"},"analysis/python/further_reading.html":{"url":"analysis/python/further_reading.html","title":"Further reading","keywords":"","body":"More advanced topics in Python\nNice standard libraries\n\nargsparse, datetime, fnmatch, glob, os, re, sys, subprocess\n\nNice libraries for data analysis\n\nnumpy, pandas, matplotlib\n\nPython and ROOT\n\npyROOT\nroot_numpy\n\n"},"analysis/bestprac/best_prac.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/best_prac.html","title":"Part 9 - Best Practices","keywords":"","body":""},"analysis/bestprac/preparing.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/preparing.html","title":"Preparing your code for debugging","keywords":"","body":"Preparing your code for debug\nIn broad terms when building software you typically have the option between\ngenerating either a release or a debug build.\nThis also applies to ROOT, AliRoot, AliPhysics, and your compiled analysis tasks\nand macros. As the name suggests:\n\nrelease builds are meant for production and should be used when running\nyour code at scale;\ndebug builds should be used exclusively when trying to sort out problems\nin the code.\n\nThere are two main correlated characteristics that differ between release and\ndebug builds:\n\ncompile-time optimization\ndebug symbols\n\nCompile-time optimization\nEvery compiler performs some form of optimization while producing executables\nand libraries. Optimizing a code while compiling means that the compiler does\nnot merely translate a written programming language into machine code, but it\nalso tries to interpret up to a certain extent what the code aims to do.\nAll levels of optimization have the result of avoiding unnecessary code to be\nexecuted, and since optimization requires some code analysis, compilation time\nis longer (even if this is mostly unnoticeable with modern computers).\nDifferent levels of optimization can be choosen, ranging from no optimization\nto aggressive optimization; the most common compilers (for instance, clang\nor gcc) you would use the following switches:\n[-O0|-O1|-O2|-O3|-Ofast|-Os|-Oz|-O|-O4]\nThe default optimization level for the aforementioned compilers is -O2:\nhigher levels of optimization are typically not recommended, as they might alter\nthe program flow to a point it does no longer match any longer the developer's\nintentions.\nA list of what each -O flag enables in GCC is available on the\nGCC documentation.\nWhen debugging code, you want binary instructions generated by the compiler to\nmatch as close as possible the readable code's flow. This is one of the reasons\nwhy optimization should be turned off in such a case.\n\nIncreasing the optimization does not necessarily lead to more efficient code!\n\"Extreme\" optimizations (like -O4) are not recommended and can even lead\nto unexpected results.\n\nSymbols and debug symbols\nShared libraries and executables contain binary code divided into \"sections\",\nand \"symbols\" are a way of referring to such sections. Each function or method\nname of your code is translated into a symbol.\nExtra \"symbols\" are written to a library when compiling in debug mode, pointing\ndirectly fragments of functions to the corresponding lines in the source code.\nTo compile with clang or gcc with debug symbols, you would use the -g\nswitch: there is no guarantee that optimizations are also turned off, so you'd\nbetter specify also -O0:\ngcc -O0 -g ...\n\nThe same flags are used for clang.\nCompiling your ALICE code for debug\nComplex frameworks aren't typically built by directly invoking a compiler and\nits options: for instance, when compiling AliPhysics you use\naliBuild, managing\ndependencies between different packages, and CMake, a\ntool that generates compile commands based on the dependencies between source\nfiles inside the same project.\nA standard aliBuild compilation of AliPhysics, which is as simple as issuing:\naliBuild build AliPhysics\n\nwill use some \"defaults\" which, if no extra option is passed, are read from the\ndefaults-release.sh\nfile. Options\nin this file are such that we compile our three main packages (ROOT, AliRoot and\nAliPhysics) using both a normal optimization level (-O2) and debug symbols\n(-g).\n\nThe default configuration is sufficient in most cases and it is the same used\nfor Grid packages.\n\nYou have the option to use a different set of \"defaults\" for debug (note that\nthis will trigger a full recompilation of most packages):\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults debug\n\nSuch debug configuration uses -O0 and -g.\nYour analysis\nSuppose your analysis task is called AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask. In the macro\nyou use to load the analysis task, you can do:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask.cxx++g\");\n\nThe \"double plus\" forces recompilation, while the appended g tells ROOT to\ncompile the task with debug symbols. Once your code is in production, just\nremove the g:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask.cxx++\");\n\nPlease note that debug code is considerably slower than production code,\nalthough it provides you with more information (for instance line numbers in\nstacktraces as we will see later).\n\nOnly use debug builds for temporary tests: turn off debugging when\nsending your code to production!\n\nGot Debug Symbols? (Linux only)\nTo check if your code has been compiled with debug symbols, on Linux you can\ndo:\nnm -a libName.so | grep debug\n\nThe nm -a command lists all symbols: we grep only the ones containing the\nword \"debug\". For instance:\n$> cd $ALICE_BUILD/lib/tgt_*\n$> objdump --syms libPWGEMCAL.so\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_aranges    0000000000000000              .debug_aranges\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_info    0000000000000000              .debug_info\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_abbrev  0000000000000000              .debug_abbrev\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_line    0000000000000000              .debug_line\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_str     0000000000000000              .debug_str\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_loc     0000000000000000              .debug_loc\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_ranges  0000000000000000              .debug_ranges\n\nThe library libPWGEMCAL.so on our reference Linux installation does\ncontain debug symbols. The above command usually contains no output if no\ndebug symbols are present.\nPlease note that on macOS debug symbols do not show up with nm -a.\n"},"analysis/bestprac/general.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/general.html","title":"Some general programming tips","keywords":"","body":"Some general programming tips\nIn order to reduce as much as possible the amount of time spent debugging and\nmaking your code faster, here are some general tips you might find useful.\nUse existing algorithms for general problems\nA large portion of coding problems applied to data collections can be reduced\nto sorting or searching: even if a simple custom made array sorting\ncode looks innocuous and easy to read, when iterating over a collection of\nthousands or millions of elements its drawbacks become pretty obvious.\nAs a general rule, do not write your own sorting algorithms: standard ROOT\ndata collections, like TLists and\nTObjArrays, already have an\nefficient Sort() method.\nMoreover, if you are manually filling a TList for sorting it at a later time,\nconsider using something like the\nTSortedList, which is\ncompatible with a TList, i.e. you can do:\nTList *mySortedList = new TSortedList();\n\nbut objects are inserted in the correct order every time you Add() them,\navoiding additional time waste to order it at a later time.\nThe same considerations apply for searching algorithms: ROOT already have\nsearch functions optimized for its data structures, and if you search in a\nsorted list (like the TSortedList), search is faster.\nSearching by strings inside large collections must be avoided at all times:\nstring comparison is a very expensive operation, and it is not easy to estimate\nhow long it takes since it depends on the length of the compared strings.\nMassive string comparison, even if this is unobvious, leads to:\n\nlarge data transfers between CPU, caches and memory, hitting the bus\nlimits\ncache trashing, i.e. the constant invalidation of the caches that are\nsupposed to speed up code execution\n\nA bad example that uses massively string comparisons has been found inside ROOT\nthanks to the IgProf profiler, and the code has been amended, as we will see\nlater on.\nTo improve lookups in large collections, please consider\nTHashList instead of TList: a\n\"hash\" is a fixed-size byte sequence (usually an integer) associated to each\nelement and computed based on the content of the element, constituting a sort\nof \"fingerprint\".\nWhen performing a lookup on a hash list (i.e. find what element is identical\nto this one, or find what element has this name), the hash (\"fingerprint\") of\nthe input element is calculated, and it is compared with the hash of every\nother element in the list.\nIf two hashes match, it might mean that the two elements are identical: in\nthis case, and this case only, a deep check is performed and the response is\nreturned.\nThe big advantage is that from a shallow (hash) comparison we can tell for sure\nif two elements are different, which saves us the time required to perform a\ndeep comparison for every element.\n\nUse optimized versions of the algorithms even if they are difficult to\nunderstand, and trust them!\n\nFor a list of optimized general purpose algorithms in C and C++, have a look at\nthe Numerical Recipes, which is considered the \"sacred\ntext\" of this field.\nObject ownership\nVery often, the ownership of pointers is not clear, i.e. who created a\ncertain object, and who is responsible of garbage collecting it?\nIf you are the person defining a new object, be sure to do something like:\nAliMyObject *mo = new AliMyObject();\n// code code code\ndelete mo;\n\nYou have probably heard it lots of times already, but it is worth repeating it:\nwrite a delete every time you write a new, and think in advance of how to\ndispose of an object you created.\nROOT collections (i.e. the TLists) can be made \"owners\" of objects:\nTList *l = new TList();\nl->SetOwner(kTRUE);\n// add add add\ndelete l;\n\nThis means that when the code reaches the delete line, delete is\nautomatically invoked on each of the contained objects, so that you do not have\nto do it manually.\nNew and delete, and hidden memory operations\nPlease note that new and delete operations are very slow: never ever create\nand destroy an object per loop (for instance inside the UserExec() of the\nanalysis tasks)!\n\nSave memory and CPU, recycle objects! And if the object classes\nare defined by you, write them in a way that you can redefine\ntheir content without the need to delete and recreate them!\n\nA bad example with objects constructed per loop:\nfor (x=0; x\nEven if new and delete are not used there (objects are on the stack), the\nTLorentzVectors have their constructor and destructor invoked per loop!\nThe amended code:\nTLorentzVector vec1;\nTLorentzVector vec2;\nTLorentzVector res;\n\nfor (x=0; x\nAs you can see, the\nTLorentzVector has various Set*() methods that make it not necessary to\ndestroy and recreate the object to set new coordinates.\nAlso, do not be too zealous when deleting: in particular, do not delete\nobjects that do not belong to you.\n\nCommon example: do not delete the object if you get its pointer from a\nTDirectory (like a TFile)!\n\nChoose the ROOT container carefully: even if a TList and a TObjArray are\nboth collections capable of expanding, lists are sparse in memory, as each\nelement points to the next (and sometimes to the previous); instead, arrays\nare contiguous collections of elements in memory.\nGrowing an array requires periodic hidden realloc() low level operations\n(luckily they do not happen for every element we add), and this might be rather\nimpairing when applied to a very large collection: use a TList in such a\ncase.\nROOT I/O and objects\nA note about ROOT objects (i.e. objects inheriting from TObject, i.e.\nmost likely your own objects): ROOT as you know needs a default constructor\nfor I/O that takes no arguments. You should create at least two\nconstructors in your code for clarity:\n\nThe default one, needed by ROOT, that should be called only by ROOT when\nstoring or restoring object from a file, and should never be used by the\nprogrammer directly: do not write any memory allocation instruction there,\nleave it as empty as possible!\nThe \"explicit\" one, taking at least one argument, which should do the actual\nstuff and should be used by the programmer when creating a new object.\n\nHistograms or trees obtained from a file with statements like:\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\n\nare related to the corresponding TFile, and they are destroyed when the\nfile is closed. So, do not do that:\nTFile *myFile = TFile::Open(\"myfile.root\");\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\ndelete myFile;\nhisto->Draw();\n\nThis is because TFile owns the pointer. You can detach the histogram from\nthe file:\nTFile *myFile = TFile::Open(\"myfile.root\");\ngROOT->cd();\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\ndelete myFile;\nhisto->Draw();\n\nbut in this case you own the histogram and you must dispose of it:\n// when done...\ndelete histo;\n\nNote that you could also use histo->SetDirectory(0) for being able to close\nthe file, but it is better to attach it to the \"ROOT root directory\" in order\nto use it for instance in TTree::Draw.\nPlease note that there are in particular two objects that are automatically\nassociated to a TFile, mostly for performance reasons:\n\nHistograms (i.e. all objects inheriting from TH1)\nTrees (i.e. all objects inheriting from TTree, including the TNtuple)\n\nFor those categories of objects, the corresponding TFile owns the object. You\nmust always disassociate the object from the originating TFile if you\nwant to keep the object while closing the file.\n\nThis does not apply for objects that are neither histograms nor trees: in\nthat case (e.g a TList or a TGraph) you are responsible of\ndisposing of the object.\n\nCompiler warnings\nDo not overlook compiler warnings! Warnings should never exist in a\nclean code.\nWhenever you see a warning, you have to:\n\nfix the code, if it is actually broken: sometimes warnings get it right\nthat you are doing something wrong\nsilence the warning by rewriting the snippet in a way that it does not\ntrigger the warning.\n\nDifferent compilers give different warnings: clang is usually more precise and\ntends to give you advice on either how to silence the warning, or what you\nprobably meant when writing the code. Of course a compiler is a \"stupid\" piece\nof software and you should not always follow literally its advice, but do not\noverlook it!\nTwo good examples clarifying why warnings should not be ignored:\n\nStarting from GCC 5 many former warnings are turned into errors by default. We\nhave evaluated the opportunity to pass GCC 5 some flags to maintain the legacy\nbehavior (i.e. revert some errors into warnings) but we have found out that\nthe compiler was right: those warnings were actually faulty code that needed\nto be fixed. If the authors checked the warnings in the first place they would\nhave for sure recognized the logic errors in the code.\nWarnings clog compilation output and make more difficult to detect actual\nerrors when they occur.\n\nNote that by default aliBuild conceals the compilation output. You need to pass\nthe --debug option to actually see the warnings popping up:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --debug\n\nWhen to use pointers\nAs a general rule, it is not always a good idea to use pointers to objects as\ndata members of your class. If objects are big you are forced to use it, but\nfor many small objects you'd better use the object directly: you will save\nyourself (and the computer) a new/delete operation for each one of them. This\nhas an impact if you have many small objects.\nRemember to always initialize pointers used as data members: compilers should\nraise warnings if you do not.\nMany member pointers in custom classes are transient, i.e. they should\nexist only in memory and they should not be written to a file.  So please mark\nevery transient pointer with the appropriate special ROOT comment //! (no\nspaces between the slash and exclamation mark):\nclass MyClass : public TObject {\n  private:\n    AnotherClass *transient_ptr;  //!\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nThis comment is not just a decorator: you are telling ROOT not to save the\npointer to file, considerably reducing the output size!\n\nStrings\nA very very very bad habit found very frequently in analysis code is\nreferencing objects via their name inside the UserExec() (or any other loop):\nTH1I *h = list->FindObject(\"myHistoName\");\n\nThe FindObject() function is very (very!) expensive, furthermore it always\nreturns the same pointer for a certain object: it surely makes no sense to run\nit inside the UserExec()! Do this call once during the initialization and\nuse the cached result in the event loop!\nAlso, avoid passing \"raw\" strings as arguments to functions. Don't do:\nvoid MyClass::myfunc(TString a) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nDo instead:\nvoid MyClass::myfunc(const TString &a) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nNote that in both cases you invoke it with:\nmyfunc(\"this is a string\");\n\nwhich means that you can update your code without changing the way you call\nsuch functions.\nMoreover, it is a bad idea to use strings as triggering options on a method,\nlike:\nvoid MyClass::dosomething(const TString &what) {\n  if (what == \"this\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == \"that\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == \"something else\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nAs we have seen, string comparison is evil. Use enums instead:\nenum dowhat_t { THIS, THAT, SOMETHING_ELSE };\n\nvoid MyClass::dosomething(const dowhat_t what) {\n  if (what == THIS) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == THAT) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == SOMETHING_ELSE) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nThe code is as readable, but much more efficient.\n"},"analysis/bestprac/crash.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/crash.html","title":"Where does my code crash","keywords":"","body":"Where does my code crash?\nWhen the code you are running \"crashes\", you are usually presented with a\nbacktrace or stack trace showing the nesting level of the called\nfunctions plus some more or less \"obscure\" information.

fact that:\n\nAliRoot has been compiled with debug information: all AliRoot functions\nreport the corresponding source file and line number\nROOT has been compiled without debug information: all ROOT functions only\nreport obscure offsets\n\n\nIt is possible to mix non-debug and debug code, but we will obtain\ncomprehensible information only for the latter.\n\nIn the following sections we will present two commonly used debugging\ntechniques: one very simple based on printouts, and another one based on using\na debugger (gdb).\nDebugging with \"printf/cout\"\nThe simplest way to understand what goes on in your code is to introduce\nperiodic printouts stating the value of some variables, or simply indicating\nwhat the program is currently executing.\nPlease note that, while printouts may be useful, they surely clutter your code\nif abused: so if you end up adding one printout per code line, you'd better off\nwith a debugger, as explained in the next paragraph.\nApart from code cleanliness, printouts have a computational cost, which might\nbe non-negligible depending on the frequency of your output: we are about to\nlearn the appropriate way to add discrete debug printouts to your code in a\nway that:\n\nwe can turn them off when debug is over without additional computational costs\nwe don't have to write our code twice, one debug and one production version\n\nThe generic way\nThe simplest (and naive) way to do it in C/C++ is the following:\n// global variable\nbool gPrintDebug = true;\n\nvoid PrintDebug(const char *message) {\n  if (gPrintDebug == false)\n    return;\n  std::cout \nThe above snippet has a convenient PrintDebug() function, whose output can be\nsuppressed by simply setting the global variable gPrintDebug = false.\nHowever, the PrintDebug() function is called in any case, even if no output\nwill be produced, and this function call has a non-negligible cost; moreover,\nthe condition if (!gPrintDebug) must be tested every time, which has another\ncomputational cost.\nThe correct way is to use C/C++ preprocessor macros. The simplest way is to\nmove the condition if (!gPrintDebug) from C++ to the preprocessor:\n#include \n\n//#define PRINT_DEBUG\n\n#ifdef PRINT_DEBUG\nvoid PrintDebug(const char *message) {\n  std::cout \nIf we compile the above snippet, no call to the print function will ever be\ngenerated in the compiled code, because the condition is evaluated at compile\ntime by the code preprocessor (to be precise, this happens just before\ncompiling the code).\nTo enable print debug, you can either uncomment the #define line on top, or\ncompile the code with:\ngcc -o prog -D PRINT_DEBUG prog.cxx\n\ni.e. you can define the PRINT_DEBUG preprocessor variable on the command\nline without modifying your code.\n\nThere are fancier ways to use preprocessor macros for debug: this\none is trivial and provided as an example.\n\nThe AliRoot way: AliDebug\nAliRoot has a logging facility defined in STEER/STEERbase/AliLog.{h,cxx}:\nthere are different functions defined there that allow you to add sensible\nprintouts to your code, and you should definitely use them instead of cout or\nprintf.\nThe \"functions\" are preprocessor macros, and there is a variable associated to\neach of them, determining whether the code for the printout should be generated\nor not ar runtime:\n\n\n\nFunction\nVariable\n\n\n\n\nAliDebug(level, message)\nLOG_NO_DEBUG\n\n\nAliInfo(message)\nLOG_NO_INFO\n\n\nAliWarning(message)\nLOG_NO_WARNING\n\n\nAliError(message)\nnone\n\n\nAliFatal(message)\nnone\n\n\n\nBy defining the LOG_NO_* variables (through #define, for instance) it is\npossible to suppress all the related message outputs, but in a way that the\ngenerated code is optimized as explained in the previous paragraph.\nPlease note that:\n\nit is not possible to suppress error and fatal error messages\nyou must use those macros in a class\nyou must include AliLog.h for using them\nyou can turn them on and off selectively per class\n\nConsider the following minimal example (save it as AliLogTest.h):\n//#define LOG_NO_INFO\n#include \"AliLog.h\"\n\nclass AliLogTest : public TObject {\n  public:\n    AliLogTest() {\n      AliInfoF(\"I am %s\", \"legend\");\n    };\n  ClassDef(AliLogTest, 1);\n};\n\nLoad it via the following load.C macro:\n{\n  gSystem->AddIncludePath(\"-I$ALICE_ROOT/include\");\n  gROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliLogTest.h++\");\n  AliLogTest a;\n}\n\nRun:\naliroot -q load.C\n\nand see what happens if you uncomment the LOG_NO_INFO definition.\nPlease note that in the example above we have used a function called\nAliInfoF() (and not AliInfo()): this is not a typo.\nEach one of the aforementioned log functions has a *F version (where \"F\" is\nfor \"formatting\"), accepting the same arguments of printf (for instance, %s\nfor strings or %d for signed integers). The following two calls produce the\nsame output:\nAliInfoF(\"The goat sleeps %s\", \"on the bench\");\nAliInfo(Form(\"The goat sleeps %s\", \"on the bench\"));\n\nbut they do different things. The AliInfoF() function roughly\ntranslates to:\n// AliInfoF(message, ...)\n{\n  TString formattedMessage;\n  formattedMessage.Form(message, ...);\n  AliInfo( formattedMessage );\n}\n\nwhich allocates a TString object used as a buffer for formatting the string.\nThe Form() call, instead, uses a preallocated common circular buffer of a\ncertain, uncontrollable size: so, AliInfoF() is safer if you have to\nformat very very long strings and you fear you might overwrite the buffer or\nget your part of the buffer overwritten by something else.\n\nOn single core programs, no one overwrites your buffer before you print it\nout: you might have problems with multithreading.\n\nIn general, using the full AliInfo(Form()) is better as it does not\ncreate and destroy an object, which is costly. If you do not want to use the\ncircular buffer but also don't want to create a buffer for each call, you can\nalso allocate your own buffer once and reuse it:\nTString myBuffer;\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 1) );\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 2) );\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 3) );\n\nPlease also note that the LOG_NO_INFO define has the effect of suppressing\nalso the code generation for whatever the argument of AliInfo() is. So, if\nyou have:\n#define LOG_NO_INFO\n#include \"AliLog.h\"\n// ...\nAliInfo( Form(\"something %s, something %s\", \"borrowed\", \"blue\") );\n\nthe Form() code will not be generated.\nAs a general rule:\n\nuse AliInfo( Form() )\nrevert to a shared buffer, or AliInfoF() if you get garbled output\n\n\nChoose AliInfo() or AliInfoF() according to your needs, but be\naware of what they do under the hood!\n\nChoosing a \"debug level\"\nAliLog allows you to set the \"importance\" of your debug message, which is\ncalled the debug level: depending on the settings, you can decide to only\nprint important messages, i.e. messages with a debug level equal or greater\nthan whatever you decide.\nDebug messages are printed using AliDebug(), and the corresponding\nAliDebugF() function for printf-formatted messages. Syntax:\nAliDebug(level, message);\nAliDebugF(level, formatstring, [arg1[, arg2...]]);\n\nlevel is a positive integer setting the debug level: greater means\n\"more important\".\nThe global debug level is used to decide which messages to print.\nUse:\nAliLog::SetGlobalDebugLevel(level);\n\nOnly messages with a level greater than or equal to level will be\nprinted out.\nThe SetGlobalDebugLevel function is a static function, so you\nshould literally use it prefixed by AliLog::.\nUsing a debugger\ngdb is the GNU debugger. To install it on\nDebian-based distributions (like Ubuntu):\napt update\napt install gdb\n\ngdb and OS X\nSince some time, OS X moved to LLVM. In general, code compiled with LLVM\ncompilers cannot be debugged easily with gdb, although it is claimed now and\nthen to be compatible.\nLLVM comes with a new debugger called lldb: for the\nbasic operations, lldb's commands and its way of funcitoning are very similar,\nif not identical in some cases, to gdb.\nThe debugging example that follows contains examples and references to both gdb\nand lldb, and enough information on how to use the latter if you come from gdb.\nJust for reference,\nhere's how to install gdb on OS X\nproperly.\n\nIt is recommended you get accustomed with lldb if you use a Mac, and refrain\nfrom using gdb, as it lacks official support.\n\nTest case: a program that crashes\nConsider the following snippet:\n#include \n\n#define FLOAT_ARY 12\n\nvoid crash_function() {\n  unsigned int answer_to_everything = 42;\n  int another_number = -answer_to_everything;\n  float many_floats[FLOAT_ARY];\n  int counter_max = 10000;\n  const char *test_string = \"oh no, not again!\";\n  std::cout \n\nName it crash.cxx and compile it with debug symbols. On Linux:\ng++ -g -O0 -o crash crash.cxx\n\nOn OS X:\nclang++ -g -O0 -o crash crash.cxx\n\nThis code contains an array of floats, allocated \"on the stack\" (i.e. on the\nfunction's memory), which has space for 12 elements:\nfloat many_floats[12];\n\nHowever in the for loop we are writing way beyond its length in order to\nartificially generate a crash. Let's run it:\n$> ./crash\n...\nsetting index 811 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 812 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 813 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 814 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 815 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 816 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nSegmentation fault: 11\n\nThe program crashes at a random point as expected.\n\nWe did not obtain any stack trace automatically: this is a peculiarity of\nROOT programs.\n\nWe want to run the program under a debugger in order to:\n\nobtain a stack trace\nsee the value of the variables at the moment of the crash\n\nLoad the program under gdb:\ngdb --args ./crash\n\nOn OS X you might use lldb:\nlldb -- ./crash\n\nFrom the gdb or lldb prompt, run the program by typing run: when the program\ncrashes, we are back at the debugger's prompt.\nHere is the sample output from lldb (gdb's output is very similar):\n* thread #1: tid = 0x13c1d0, 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7fff5fc00000)\n    frame #0: 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14\n   11        std::cout  14          many_floats[i] = 0.12345;\n   15        }\n   16        std::cout The debugger is pointing us exactly to the line where the execution has\nstopped: since we have compiled the program with debug symbols, we have this\nprecise reference and the debugger can even show us the code snippet.\nTo manually show the code snippet, type list (both gdb and lldb).

With lldb:\nbreakpoint set -b func1\nWith gdb:\nbreak func1\nOr, as an alternative, we can set the breakpoint to a certain line of code.\nWith lldb:\n$> breakpoint set -l 28\nBreakpoint 1: where = crash`func1() + 15 at crash.cxx:28, address = 0x0000000100000f9f\n\nWith gdb:\n$> break set 28\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x100000f9f: file crash.cxx, line 28.\n\nNow run the program with run. It will stop where we told it to stop, even if\nit did not crash: since the execution is stopped, we can do many things:\n\nexamine the variables\nadvance line by line\nresume the normal execution\ndelete the breakpoint\n\nFor instance, we set the breakpoint before incrementing the variable\na_variable of one unit: let's print its value:\n$> print a_variable\n$0 = 456\n\nProcess next line with next, or simply n, then examine again:\n$> n\n$> print a_variable\n$1 = 457\n\nThe variable was correctly incremented by one unit like expected.

They are very\nheavy for production operations.\n\nValgrind\nValgrind is a complex and robust tool to perform code\nanalysis and profiling.\nValgrind is composed of many tools, each one of them performing a different\ntask. The two tools we are interested in are:\n\nmemcheck: the memory checker\ncallgrind: a performance profiler\n\nInstalling Valgrind on Ubuntu is easy:\napt install valgrind\n\nOn OS X it is easy as well. With Homebrew:\nbrew install valgrind\n\nMemory check\nMemory checks with Valgrind are useful to find the following memory\nproblems:\n\ninvalid memory reads\ninvalid memory writes\npotential memory leaks\n\nValgrind will indicate the potential problems in the logfile it\nproduces. Since it can be hard to understand the logfile, there are\nalso graphical tools showing:\n\nmemory trends (with respect to running time): useful to see when and\nhow the memory grows\nallocation peaks: useful to see which are the parts of your code\nmaking the most memory allocations\n\nWe recommend using the massif-visualizer tool. On Ubuntu 14.04, it can be\ninstalled by\ngetting it from the Kubuntu repositories:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install massif-visualizer\nRun your program under Valgrind's memory check. The following command\nis suitable for AliRoot (see man valgrind for more details):\nvalgrind \\\n  --tool=memcheck \\\n  --error-limit=no \\\n  --max-stackframe=3060888 \\\n  --suppressions=$ROOTSYS/etc/valgrind-root.supp \\\n  --leak-check=no \\\n  --num-callers=40 \\\n  --log-file=/tmp/valgrind_memory.log \\\n  aliroot -b -q launchMyAnalysis.C+\n\nA couple of notes.\n\nThe --suppressions switch is used to tell Valgrind which alleged\nmemory problems to ignore. The file we pass to it is the ROOT\nsuppressions file, and greatly simplifies the produced output by\nreducing false positives.\nThe --leak-check=no makes the execution much faster, but it does\nnot check for memory leaks. Use --leak-check=full for a deeper\ninspection, but expect a longer running time.\n\n\nValgrind traps all memory operations through an internal \"virtual\nmachine\": this is why it can be up to 40 times slow. Run your\nprogram under Valgrind on a very small dataset!\n\nTo produce data readable with the massif-visualizer, use\n--tool=massif, which invokes the\nmassif heap analyzer\ninstead of memcheck.\nAn example of the interactive output produced by massif-visualizer is\npresented:\n\nPerformance profiler\nValgrind has a performance profiler called\ncallgrind. Its\npurpose, like IgProf, is to analyze how much time is spent in each\nfunction. As we have already discussed, being a deterministic tool\nevery single function of your program is trapped and captured, which\nmakes the tool very precise, but also very slow.\nCallgrind's output can be analyzed by means of the KCachegrind program\nthat can be installed on Ubuntu 14.04 with:\nsudo apt install kcachegrind\n\nThe typical way of invoking Valgrind's callgrind for AliRoot programs is:\nvalgrind\n  --tool=callgrind \\\n  --log-file=/tmp/valgrind_callgrind.log \\\n  aliroot -b -q launchMyAnalysis.C+\n\nThe produced output can be browsed interactively by means of KCachegrind. An\noutput similar to the following is presented:\n\nwhere colored blocks indentify graphically which are the functions where your\nprogram spends most of its time.\n"}}}
