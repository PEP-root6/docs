ROOT6\nROOT6 is similar to ROOT5: It comes with the same library of classes (base\nclasses, histogram classes like TH1, ...) which share the same interface as under\nROOT5. It provides a command line interface as ROOT5, and runs macros just\nlike under ROOT5. Therefore it is possible to build and run the ALICE\nsimulation, reconstruction and analysis framework under ROOT6. AliPhysics can be\nbuilt against ROOT6 in the following way:\naliBuild -z --defaults root6 build AliPhysics\n\nFor classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics this transition is transparent. For code in\nmacros there are however a few difference. This page tries to summarize the\ndifferences in behaviour observed so far and gives some suggestions how to solve\nthese issues so work can go on smoothly under ROOT6.\nWhat is a just-in-time compiler?\nFor the command line interface and running macros ROOT5 uses CINT, which is an\ninterpreter for C/C++. An interpreter processes a macro line-by-line. It depends\non the implementation of the interpreter how C++ code will be handled and how\nclose the interpretation comes to the language standard. ROOT5 allows for some\ndeviations from the language standards, which means that some coding errors\nwhich would thrown by a compiler leading in a break of the compilation are still\ntolerated by ROOT5. Furthermore the standard library is not fully supported as\nits handling has to be implemented into the compiler. Macro can however also be\nrun in the compiled mode by ROOT5 (adding a \"+\" to the macro name). In this case\nROOT calls an external compiler to compile the macro to a library which is loaded\ninto ROOT. Once the macro runs in compiled mode it is expected to be fully\ncompatible with the C++ standard and coding error free as the compiler will not\ntolerate compiler errors.\nIn contrast to this ROOT6 uses a just-in-time compiler called cling. A\njust-in-time compiler translates each statement, no matter whether it is a single\ncommand or a complicated macro, into machine code as it would be a program and\nonly afterwards runs this piece of code. In order to translate code into machine\ncode the compiler must know how to translate every single line. Based on powerful\ncompiler library this means for ROOT6 that all macro must comply to 100% with\nthe C++ language standard, and exceptions will not be tolerated. Furthermore this\nalso means that all symbols and objects must be known at compile time. This has\nthree side effects:\n\nLoading Functions with gROOT->LoadMacro(...);: This function loads all\nfunctions it finds within the macro into ROOT during run time. For an interpreter\nthis is sufficient as the functions are used after they are loaded. However the\ncompiler must know all symbols used in a macro at compile time.\nLoading libraries with gSystem->Load(...);: Here we have the same problem:\nThe symbols in the libraries must be known before they are used.\nCompiling ALICE analysis tasks on the fly with gROOT->LoadMacro(\"...+\");:\nAs the analysis task compiled like this will be converted in a library it must be\nknow to the just-in-time compiler before.\n\nFor all three cases exist workarounds which will be discussed in the next\nsections. In general macros which were running under ROOT5 in the compiled mode\nwill also run under ROOT6. Macros which were running only in the interpreted\nmode might contain coding errors which were not handled by ROOT5 and might\ntherefore need fixes. However the just-in-time compiler will give precise error\nmessages leading exactly to the lines which need fixes.\nHow can I call macros inside macros?\nCalling macros inside macros is a bit tricky as the result of a macro will be\navailable only at runtime. There are however several workarounds which cover the \nmost common use cases:\n\nUsing ROOT's TMacro:\nTMacro is a wrapper class around the macro processing. It is constructed with\nthe macro path. The macro is run using TMacro::Exec. The result of\nTMacro::Exec() is a number representing an address in memory where to\nfind the resulting object. This has to be cast into a pointer to an object of\nthe expected type. Example:\nTMacro physseladd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"));\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(physseladd.Exec());\n\nThe macro is still evaluated at runtime, however with the reinterpret_cast to\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask * we tell ROOT that the result of the macro\ninterpretation must be of type AliPhysicsSelectionTask *, so the type is known\nat compile time. TMacro::Exec optionally gets a string representation of the\nfunction arguments. This might be a bit complicated to handle, particularly if\nthe arguments are dynamic and change at run time. The method works both for\nROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nUsing gROOT/gInterpreter->ProcessLine: \nMacro execution can be launched as well via gROOT->ProcessLine() /\ngInterpreter->ProcessLine(). As with TMacro this method is focused on running\na macro and not loading content from it. The ProcessLine method returns a\nlong number representing an address in memory where to find the output objects.\nThis number has to be cast to the expected output type using a\nreinterpret_cast in order to access the content of the output objects. The\nfollowing example runs the add macro for the physics selection task:\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ProcessLine(Form(\".x %s\", gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"))))\n\nAdding function arguments is possible here as well as a simple string\nrepresentation after the macro path, surrounded with (). This method also works\nboth under ROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nIncluding macros:\nAs ROOT6 compiles the macro it is possible to include macros and treat them\nas if they were header files. In order for this to work it is essential to tell\nROOT before where to find the macro. This can be done using the preprocessor\nmacro R_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH(...). For the just-in-time compiler macros\nincluded will look as if they were part of the code itself. The following macro\nruns under ROOT6:\n#ifdef __CLING__\n// Tell  ROOT where to find AliRoot headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_ROOT)\n#include \n\n// Tell ROOT where to find AliPhysics headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_PHYSICS)\n#include \n#endif\n\nvoid simpleaddtest(){\n  AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager;\n\n  // Take function from macro AddESDHandler\n  // no gROOT->LoadMacro for ROOT6\n  AddESDHandler();\n\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask *test = AddTaskPhysicsSelection(kTRUE);\n\n  mgr->InitAnalysis();\n  mgr->PrintStatus();\n}\n\nIn particular when passing arguments to the macro (in the example above passing\nkTRUE to AddTaskPhysicsSelection) this method is very convenient. This method\nis specific to ROOT6. The part including macros has to be protected (see\nbelow).\n\n\nDo I need to include header files in my macros?\nROOT6 comes with a technique called pre-compiled header files. Header files\nfrom a certain library are compiled to a binary format by rootcling, the\nsuccessor of rootcint, and loaded into ROOT6 by an auto-loading mechanism\nsimilar to the rootmap mechanism. Once rootcling is invoked with the\nargument -rml name a .pcm-file is created containing the pre-compiled\nheaders. ROOT6 will search for .pcm-files in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nThe following packages in ALICE provide .pcm support:\n\nAliRoot\nAliPhysics\nRooUnfold\nFairRoot\no2\n\nFor libraries providing .pcm-support NO headers should be included in macros.\nFor libraries handled by the user make sure to\n\nrun rootcling with the arguments -rmf for the .rootmap file\nand -rml for the .pcm file\nInstall both the .rootmap and the .pcm file of your library path in the \nlibrary location (usually PROJECT_PATH/lib)\n\nI get a huge amount of errors, and my macro doesn't run. What can I do?\nHere are few examples that commonly appear in user macros and which are tolerated by ROOT5 but not anymore by ROOT6:\n\nUndefined symbols:\nMaybe you have something like this in your code:\ntaskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThe variable taskname was not defined before. It was implicitly defined in ROOT5 as const char *. In ROOT6 this leads to the error\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'taskname'\nThe variable taskname must be defined with a type before a value can be assigned. In this case the proper code would be\nconst char *taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThanks to C++11 ROOT6 can also detect the type implicitly using the keyword\nauto. In this case the code looks the following:\nauto taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThis will however not be transparent to ROOT5 as ROOT5 doesn't understand\nC++11.\nNote: On the command line ROOT6 automatically adds the auto keyword. The \nstatement above will be possible in the interpreted mode of ROOT6.\n\nMissing forward declarations\nConsider this macro:\nvoid fail_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nUnder ROOT5 this macro will run, but under ROOT6 it will raise the following compiler error:\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'test'\nThe function test is defined, but after it is used. In ROOT5 this is\nno problem: During interpretation the interpreter loads all functions. But\nunder ROOT6 the macro is compiled, and now the order matters: Functions need\nto be declared before they are used. Adding a forward declaration is \nsufficient in order to make the macro working. The following version of\nthe macro will run also under ROOT6:\nint test(int a, int b);\n\nvoid run_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nHandling of pointer and objects:\nROOT5 does not enforce using the proper access operator for objects, pointers and\nreferences, but will allow the usage of the operator -> for\nreferences and the operator . for pointers. ROOT6 distinguishes\nbetween them, and consequently the proper access operator needs to be used.\nConsider the following macro:\nvoid fail_access(){\n  TH1F *ptr = new TH1F(\"ptr\", \"ptr\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  ptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n\n  TH1F obj(\"obj\", \"obj\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj.GetTitle());\n}\n\nConsequently the wrong access operator is used. ROOT5 will warn about the\nincorrect access operator, but it will run the macro. Trying this under ROOT6\nends in the following errors:\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\nptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  ~~~^\n     ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^\n                             ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  ~~~^~\n     .\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj->GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^~\n                             .\n\n\nI get a huge amount of unknown symbols from classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics? Do I still need to include header files?\nIn case the compilation of a macro under ROOT6 fails libraries and pre-compiled\nheaders from external packages are not loaded. The consequence is that ROOT6\ndoes not know about these classes and will raise errors about unknown symbols.\nOnce all the initial compiler errors are fixed (usually at the very top of\nthe error log), the next time the macros are compiled ROOT6 will also load the\nlibraries and .pch files from external libraries and the errors disappear. Header\nfrom ALICE libraries should NOT be included.\nHow do I distinguish between ROOT5 and ROOT6 in my macros?\nSometimes macros require different treatment for ROOT5 and ROOT6. It is then\nnecessary to know which ROOT version is used while the macro is running.\nROOT5 defines the preprocessor macro __CINT__, which can be used to check\nwhether one is in an interpreter session. In current (up to at least v6-12-04)\nhowever also ROOT6 exports __CINT__, so this macro cannot be used to\ndistinguish between ROOT versions.\nROOT6 in addition __CLING__ which is not present in ROOT5. The following lines \nindicate how to run ROOT5/ROOT6 specific code:\n#if defined(__CLING__)\n  // ROOT6-specific code here ...\n#elif defined(__CINT__)\n  // ROOT5-specific code here ...\n#endif\n\nI heard TF1 has changed fundamentally. Is there something to be aware of?\nTF1 is based on TFormula for the formula representation. TFormula got a heavy\nchange: In ROOT5 formulas were always interpreted on-the-fly. With ROOT6 they\nare compiled by the just-in-time compiler. While this leads to a significant\nspeedup in particular when the formula is evaluated multiple times (in fit\nprocedures for example) it comes on cost of breaking backward compatibility, for\nwhich reading TFormula/TF1 object created with ROOT6 with ROOT5 will lead to\nerrors. For what concerns TFormala a ROOT5-compatible version has been added to\nROOT6 as ROOT::v5::TFormula, however something similar does not exist for\nTF1. In order to read a TF1 object from a ROOT file under ROOT5 it has to be\ncreated under ROOT5.\nNow my macro finally works under ROOT6. Will it still work under ROOT5?\nIt depends whether the macro now contains something which ROOT5 does NOT\nunderstand.\n\nROOT6 is fully compatible with C++11. In ROOT5 C++11 support is not\nimplemented, but the standard C++98 is used. C++11-specific code will not\nbe understood.\nAll NEW features provided by ROOT6 are of course not ported to ROOT5.\nThis in particular affects:\nTTreeReader\nTProcPool\nTDataFrame\n...\n\n\nStandard library support in ROOT5, while it comes out-if-the-box in ROOT6.\nIf the macro should run under both ROOT versions consider ROOT containers\ninstead.\nIf your classes write stl-containers containing ROOT-objects to a ROOT-file \nthey must be declared to ROOT5 in your LinkDef.h file. Example:#pragma link C++ class std::vector+;\n\nFor ROOT6 this is not necessary.\n\n\n\n"},"analysis/vectorization.html":{"url":"analysis/vectorization.html","title":"Part 6 - Vectorization","keywords":"","body":"vectorization\n"},"analysis/declarative.html":{"url":"analysis/declarative.html","title":"Part 7 - Declarative analysis","keywords":"","body":"declarative\n"},"analysis/python/":{"url":"analysis/python/","title":"Part 8 - Python","keywords":"","body":"An introduction to Python\nPython is a programming language.

The interesting thing about Python 3 is that \nit isn’t backwards compatible with Python 2. This means that code that works \nwhen run with version 2 of Python may not necessarily work when run with \nversion 3.

The \nanswer is the dot operator ..\n>>> math.sin\n\n\nOperators are special pieces of the syntax of a programming language.\nSyntax is the way you express what you want to do.\nIn Python, an operator acts on the thing that’s on the right of it using the \nthing on the left. In the example we just saw, the dot operator . acts on \nmath in a way that, somehow, retrieves a method called math.sin. We can \nthen use that method straight away:\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(math.pi)\n1.2246467991473532e-16\n\nHere we see there’s also a property of math called pi, which seems to \nhave the appropriate value.\nWe could also store the result of math.sin in a variable, and use it later.\n>>> twopi = 2*math.pi\n>>> my_sin = math.sin\n>>> my_sin(twopi)\n-2.4492935982947064e-16\n\nThere are several symbols that can be used as operators, like +, -, *, \nand /. Certain things support the use of certain operators. For example, \nnumbers support the plus operator:\n>>> 1 + 2\n3\n\nThe plus operator acts on 1 with 2, and, somehow, 1 knows how to deal \nwith 2, in this case by performing addition as we know it.\nWhen we do 1 + 2, what’s going on behind the scenes is exactly the same as \nwhen do math.sin. Observe!\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__add__(2)\n3\n\nNumbers have a special __add__ method attached to them, in the same way \nthat math has a sin method attached. The plus operator + is just a \nshortcut for accessing this __add__ method. The double underscores either \nside of the name tell you that there’s something special about it; in this case \nit means that you can use the plus operator + instead.\n Methods for other operatorsThe other operators that you can use with numbers have corresponding methods. \nWhat other operator methods are available? Try some of them out, and see how \nthey compare with using the operator like normal.\n SolutionClick to expandWe’ve already met two ways that you can find out what things are attached to \nsomething. In IPython, you can try (1).__, or you can always use the \ndir method.\n>>> dir(1)\n['__abs__',\n '__add__',\n '__and__',\n '__bool__',\n ...\n 'to_bytes']\n\nThen it’s just a case of scanning through this list and seeing what names look \nright. The __sub__ name looks like ‘subtraction’, and similarly __mul__ and \n__truediv__ sound like multiplication and division.\n>>> (1).__mul__(5)\n5\n>>> (1).__truediv__(5)\n0.2\n\n\nOf course, there’s also a method for the dot operator! It’s called \n__getattribute__, and it takes the name of the thing you want to get.\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')\n\n\nSo, of course, we can do this horrible one-liner:\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')(3)\n4\n\nYou would never do something like this in your day-to-day programming, but \nwe’ve done it here to illustrate how Python performs operations.\nObjects\nThe use of the dot operator is interesting because we’re manipulating the \nfundamental building block of Python: objects. Objects are containers of \nthings, and we can access those things by name using the dot operator.\nWe can sometimes use other operators as a shorthand for accessing \nspecially-named methods within objects, like using + for __add__.\nMost things in Python are objects! Numbers, like we’ve seen, are objects, \nbecause we can retrieve things from them with ..  Of course, the object \nitself is interesting because it can represent a value, like the number \n999.\nIt the next set of lessons, we’ll go through the different types of objects \nthat come with the Python language.\n"},"analysis/python/numbers.html":{"url":"analysis/python/numbers.html","title":"Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Numbers\nThere’s nothing magical about numbers in Python, and we’ve already discovered \nhow we perform operations on them.\n>>> (2*(1 + 3) - 5)/0.5\n2\n>>> 11 % 4\n3\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that Python has a few different types of \nnumbers, and they can behave differently.\n>>> 10/3\n3\n>>> 10.0/3.0\n3.3333333333333335\n\nInteresting. Something different happens when we use numbers with and without \ndecimal places! This occurs because numbers given with decimal places, like \n3.14  are floats, while those without, like 3, are integers.\nFor historical reasons, dividing two integers in Python 2 returns an integer, \nwhere the intermediate result is always rounded down. Division using at least \none float gives us the more intuitive answer.\nIn Python 3, division with integers works the same way as with floats. You can \nask to have this behaviour in Python 2.\n>>> from __future__ import division\n>>> 3/4\n0.75\n>>> 3.0/4.0\n0.75\n\nBecause the default behaviour in Python 2 is quite unintuitive, we recommend \nusing the from __future__ import division line everywhere. We’ll come to what exactly this \nline is doing shortly.\nIf you do want a rounding division, you then can ask for it explicitly with \nthe // operation:\n>>> 10/3\n3.3333333333333335\n\n>>> 10//3\n3\n\n OperatorsThis behaviour can be explained in terms of operators and the double-underscore \nmethods. You can see that numbers have two methods for division:\n>>> dir(1)\n[...,\n '__floordiv__',\n ...\n '__truediv__',\n ...]\n\nIn Python 2, the / operator corresponded to the __floordiv__ method when \nused with integers, but the __truediv__ operator when used with floats. In \nPython 3, and when using the from __future__ import division line, the / \noperator always uses the __truediv__ method.\n\nPython also lets you manipulate complex numbers, using j to represent the \ncomplex term.\n>>> a = 1 + 4j\n>>> b= 4 - 1j\n>>> a - b\n(-3+5j)\n\nComplex numbers are objects, of course, and have some useful functions and \nproperties attached to them.\n>>> a.conjugate()\n(1-4j)\n>>> a.imag\n4.0\n>>> a.real\n1.0\n\nSomewhat confusingly, computing the magnitude of a complex number can be done \nwith the abs method, which is available globally.\n>>> abs(a)\n4.123105625617661\n>>> import math\n>>> math.sqrt(a.real**2 + a.imag**2)\n4.123105625617661\n\nThis also demonstrates the ** operator, which for real numbers corresponds to \nexponentiation.\nEach type of number can be created literally, like we’ve been doing, by just \ntyping the number into your shell or source code, and by using the correspond \nmethods.\n>>> int()\n0\n>>> float()\n0.0\n>>> complex()\n0j\n\n"},"analysis/python/strings.html":{"url":"analysis/python/strings.html","title":"Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nNumber objects are useful for storing values which are, well, numbers.

This is useful because we can copy-paste the \nstring into some Python code to use it somewhere else, without having to worry \nabout escaping things.\nWe can create multi-line strings by using three quotation marks. \nConventionally, double quotations are usually used for these.\n>>> long_fact = \"\"\"This is a long string.\n...\n...

Strings are said to be \nimmutable for this reason: you can never change a string, just make new ones.\nFormatting\nOne of the most common things you’ll find yourself doing with strings is \ninterleaving values into them. For example, you’ve finished an amazing \nanalysis, and want to print the results.\n>>> result1 = 123.0\n>>> result2 = 122.3\n>>> print 'My results are: ' + str(result1) + ', ' + str(result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nThis is already quite ugly, and will only get worse with more results. We can \ninstead use the format method that’s available on strings, and use the \nspecial {} placeholders to say where we want the values to go in the string.\n>>> template = 'My results are: {0}, {1}'\n>>> print template.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nMuch better! We define the whole string at once, and then place the missing \nvalues in later.\nThe numbers inside the placeholders, {0} and {1}, correspond to the indices \nof the arguments passed to the format method, where 0 is the first \nargument, 1 is the second, and so on. By referencing positions like this, we \ncan easily repeat placeholders in the string, but only pass the values once to \nformat.\n>>> template2 = 'My results are: {0}, {1}. But the best is {0}, obviously.'\n>>> print template2.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nYou can also use named placeholders, then passing the values to format \nusing the same name.\n>>> template3 = 'My results are: {best}, {worst}. But the best is {best}, obviously.'\n>>> print template3.format(best=result1, worst=result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nThis is nice because it gives more meaning to what the placeholders are for.\nThere’s a lot you can do inside the placeholders, such as specifying that you want to format a number with a certain number of decimal places.\n>>> print 'This number is great: {0:.3f}'.format(result1)\nThis number is great: 123.000\n\nIf you want to print a literal curly brace using format, you will need to\nescape it by doubling it, so that {{ will become { and }} will become }.\nHere's an example:\n>>> print 'This number will be surrounded by curly braces: {{{0}}}'.format(123)\nThis number will be surrounded by curly braces: {123}\n\nThe innermost {0} is replaced with the number, and {{...}} becomes {...}.\n"},"analysis/python/lists.html":{"url":"analysis/python/lists.html","title":"Lists and looping","keywords":"","body":"Lists and looping\nNow things start to get really interesting!

This is called looping, or iterating, and is super easy.\n>>> for item in a:\n...     print item\n...\n4\n2\n9\n45\n\nWe have to indent the code inside the for loop to tell Python that these\nlines should be run for every iteration.\n Indentation in PythonThe for loop is a block, and every Python block requires indentation, unlike\nother \"free-form\" languages such as C++ or Java. This means that Python will\nthrow an error if you don't indent:\n>>> for i in b:\n... print i\n  File \"\", line 2\n    print i\n        ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n\nIndentation must be consistent within the same block, so if you indent two lines\nin the same for loop using a different number of spaces, Python will complain\nonce again:\n>>> for i in b:\n...   print \"I am in a loop\"\n...     print i\n  File \"\", line 3\n    print i\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\nIndentation is necessary as Python does not use any keyword or symbol to\ndetermine the end of a block (e.g. there is no endfor). As a side effect,\nindentation forces you to make your code more readable!\nNote that it does not matter how many spaces you use for indentation. As a\nconvention, we are using four spaces.\n\nThe variable name item can be whatever we want, but its value is changed by \nPython to be the element of the item we’re currently on, starting from the \nfirst.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can try to modify the length of the list whilst \nwe’re iterating.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     del a_copy[0]\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[9, 45]\n\nIntuitively, you might expect a_copy to be empty, but it’s not! The technical\nreasons aren’t important, but this highlights an important rule: never\nmodify the length of a list whilst iterating over it! You won’t end up with\nwhat you expect.\nYou can, however, freely modify the values of each item in the list whilst \nlooping. This is a very common use case.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> i = 0\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     a_copy[i] = 2*item\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nKeeping track of the current index ourselves, with i is annoying, but luckily \nPython gives us a nicer way of doing that.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n...\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Firstly, note that Python lets you assign values \nto multiple variables at the same time.\n>>> one, two = [34, 43]\n>>> print two, one\n43 34\n\nThat’s already pretty cool! But then think about what happens if you had a list \nwhere each item was another list, each containing two numbers.\n>>> nested = [[20, 29], [30, 34]]\n>>> for item in nested:\n...     print item\n...\n[20, 29]\n[30, 34]\n\nSo, we can just assign each item in the sublist to separate variables in the \nfor statement.\n>>> for one, two in nested:\n...     print two, one\n...\n29 20\n34 30\n\nNow we can understand a little better what enumerate does: for each item in \nthe list, it returns a new list containing the current index and the item.\n>>> enumerate(a)\n\n>>> list(enumerate(a))\n[(0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 9), (3, 45)]\n\nFor performance reasons enumerate doesn’t return a list directly, but instead\nsomething that the for statement knows how to iterate over (this is called a\ngenerator and for the moment you\ndon't need to know how it works). We can convert it to a list with the list\nmethod when we want to see what’s it doing.\nThis technique of looping over lists of lists lets us loop over two lists \nsimultaneously, using the zip method.\n>>> for item, item2 in zip(a, a_doubled):\n...     print item2, item\n...\n8 4\n4 2\n18 9\n90 45\n\nNeat! As before, we can see what zip is doing explicitly by using list.\n>>> list(zip(a, a_doubled))\n[(4, 8), (2, 4), (9, 18), (45, 90)]\n\nYou can see that the structure of the list that’s iterated over, the output of \nzip, is identical to that for enumerate.\nFinally, we’ll take a quick look at the range method.\n>>> range(0, 10)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nThe arguments to range work just like slicing, the second argument is treated \nexclusively, as its value is excluded from the output. Again like slicing, we \ncan specify a third argument as the step size for the iteration.\n>>> range(0, 10, 2)\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nIf you only give a single argument to range, it assumes you’ve given the end \nvalue, and want a starting value of zero.\n>>> range(5)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nThis reads “give me a list of length 5, in steps of 1, starting from zero”.\nNow that we know how to easily generate sequences of numbers, we can write \nenumerate by hand!\n>>> for index, item in zip(range(len(a)), a):\n...     print index, item\n...\n0 4\n1 2\n2 9\n3 45\n\nJust like before! When you see something cool like enumerate, it can be fun \ntrying to see how you’d accomplish something similar with different building \nblocks.\nList comprehension\nWe’ve already made a new list from an existing one when we created a_doubled.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n\nCreating a new list from an existing one is a common operation, so Python has a \nshorthand syntax called list comprehension.\n>>> a_doubled = [2*item for item in a]\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nIsn’t that beautiful?\nWe can use the same multi-variable stuff we learnt whilst looping.\n>>> [index*item for index, item in enumerate(a)]\n[0, 2, 18, 135]\n\nWe’re not restricted to creating new lists with the same structure as the \noriginal.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4], [9, 81], [45, 2025]]\n\nWe can even filter out items from the original list using if.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a if item % 2 == 0]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4]]\n\nList comprehensions are a powerful way of succinctly creating new lists. But be \nresponsible; if you find you’re doing something complicated, it’s probably \nbetter to write a full for loop.\nTuples\nA close relative of lists are tuples, which differ in that they cannot be \nmutated after creation.  You can create tuples literally using parentheses, or \nconvert things to tuples using the tuple method.\n>>> a = (3, 4)\n>>> del a[0]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion\n>>> a.append(5)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\n>>> a[0] = 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n>>> b = tuple([65, 'yes'])\n>>> b\n(65, 'yes')\n\nTuples are usually used to describe data whose length is meaningful in and of \nitself. For example, you could express coordinates as a tuple.\n>>> coords = (3.2, 0.1)\n>>> x, y = coords\n\nThis is nice because it doesn’t make sense to append to an (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) \ncoordinate, nor to ‘delete’ a dimension. Generally, it can be useful if the \ndata structure you’re using respects the meaning of the data you’re storing.\nIf you can’t think of a use for tuples yourself, its worth keeping in mind that \nPython creates tuples for groups of things by default. We saw that \nearlier when we used enumerate.\n>>> list(enumerate([4, 9]))\n[(0, 4), (1, 9)]\n\nEach element of the list is a tuple.\n Write a list comprehension yourselfCompute the square of the magnitude of the sum of the following two \nthree-vectors, using a single list comprehension and the global sum method.\n>>> kaon = [3.4, 4.3, 20.0]\n>>> pion = [1.4, 0.9, 19.8]\n\nIt might help to first think about how you’d compute the quantity for a single \nvector.\n SolutionClick to expandNot sure what the sum method does? Ask for help!\n>>> help(sum)\n\nThe square magnitude is the sum of the squares of the components, where the \ncomponents are the sum of the two input vectors.\n>>> magsq = sum([(k + pi)**2 for k, pi in zip(kaon, pion)])\n\nThe square root of this is around 40.42.\n\n"},"analysis/python/dictionaries.html":{"url":"analysis/python/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nYou can think of lists as a mapping from indices to values. The indices are\nalways integers and go from 0 to len(the_list), and the values are the\nitems.\nDictionaries are collections, just like lists, but they have important\ndifferences:\n\nlists map sequential numeric indices to items, whereas dictionaries can map\nmost object types to any object,\nlists are ordered collections of items, whereas dictionaries have no\nordering.\n\nSince anything can be used as index for an item, indices must be always\nspecified when creating a dictionary:\n>>> d = {1: 0.5, 'excellent index': math.sin, 0.1: 2}\n>>> d[1]\n0.5\n>>> d['excellent index']\n\n>>> d[0.1] = 3\n\nThe \"indices\" of a dictionary are called keys, and the things they map to\nare values. Together, each key-value pair is an item.\n>>> d.keys()\n[1, 0.1, 'excellent index']\n>>> d.values()\n[0.5, 2, ]\n>>> d\n{0.1: 2, 1: 0.5, 'excellent index': }\n\nAs you can see, the values of a dictionary can be whatever we like, and need not\nbe the same type of object.\nYou can see that the order of the keys, values and items we get back are not the\nsame as the order we created the dictionary with. If you run the same example on\nyour own you might get a different ordering. This is what we mean when we define\ndictionaries as unordered collections: when you iterate over its content, you\ncannot rely on the ordering.\nIt is however guaranteed that the n-th item returned by keys() corresponds\nto the n-th item returned by values(). This allows the following example\nto work flawlessly:\n>>> for key, value in zip(d.keys(), d.values()):\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nOf course, this could be considerably simpler just by using items(), which\ngives us tuples of key-value pairs.\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe can create dictionaries from lists of 2-item lists.\n>>> dict(enumerate(['a thing', 'another']))\n{0: 'a thing', 1: 'another'}\n\nAnd also with dictionary comprehensions, in a similar manner to list\ncomprehensions, with the additional specification of the key.\n>>> {i: i**i for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 4, 4: 256, 5: 3125}\n\nNote that dictionary comprehensions require at least Python 2.7 to work.\nDictionary keys\nThere’s no restriction on values a dictionary might hold, but there is on keys.\n>>> l = [1, 4, 3]\n>>> dd = {}\n>>> dd[l] = 0\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\nIn essence, keys must not be mutable. This includes numbers, strings, and\ntuples, but not lists. This restriction is a trade-off that allows Python to\nmake accessing values in a dictionary by key very fast.\n HashingImmutable data types in Python have a __hash__() function, you can test it\nyourself:\n>>> s = \"a string\"\n>>> s.__hash__()\n-8411828025894108412\n\nA hashing function creates an\nencoded (but not unique) representation of the object as a number. When you\nlook up an item in a Python dictionary with my_dict[\"my_key\"], what happens\ninternally is:\n\nhash of \"my_key\" is calculated,\nthis number is compared to every hash of every key in the dictionary, until a\nmatch between the hashes is found,\nif two hashes match, and the two objects are really identical, the\ncorresponding dictionary item is returned.\n\nLooking up numbers instead of strings or tuples is considerably faster, but\nsince two different strings can have the same hash, their content has to be\ncompared as well to really tell whether they are equal. If two hashes are\ndifferent on the other hand we are sure that the objects are different as well.\n\nIteration over dictionaries is over their keys.\n>>> for key in d:\n...     print key, ':' d[key]\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe have already seen how to iterate over values (using d.values()) or keys\nand values simultaneously (using d.items()).\n On the efficiency of items()In Python 2, using items copies the keys and values of a dictionary, and gives\nyou back those copies. This can be problematic for large dictionaries as the\namount of memory your program uses can double. Python 3 uses a much more\nmemory-efficient way of implementing items so that you don't have to worry.\nIf you're having memory problems with using items in Python 2, you can use\nviewitems() instead, which behaves the same way as items does in Python 3.\nNote that there are also similar methods for keys and values, called\nviewkeys() and viewvalues(), and that all of these view methods are only\navailable from\nPython 2.7.\n\n Alphabet mappingMap each letter of the alphabet to a number with a dictionary comprehension,\nstarting with 0 for a and ending with 25 for z.\nYou can get a string containing the letters of the alphabet like this:\n>>> import string\n>>> string.ascii_lowercase\n'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nYou can iterate over a string exactly like a list.\n>>> for character in string.ascii_lowercase:\n...     print character\n...\na\nb\n...\nz\n\nThen, create the \"reverse\" dictionary, again with a comprehension, mapping\nletters to numbers.\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to have a list containing one number per letter, and to loop over that\nlist along with the characters in the string. This is exactly the same as\nlooping over items in a list alongside the index, so we can use enumerate.\n>>> alphabet_map = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase)}\n\nWe can create the inverse map by swapping the key and value in the\ncomprehension.\n>>> reverse_map = {c: i for i, c in alphabet_map.items()}\n\n\n"},"analysis/python/conditions.html":{"url":"analysis/python/conditions.html","title":"Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Conditions\nSometimes, often while looping, you only want to do things depending on\nsomething’s value.

If this also isn’t met, the else block is run. You can use as many\nelif conditions as you like, or none at all, and the else block is optional.\n Ternary conditional operatorYou can use a succinct one-line syntax for conditional assignments like this:\n>>> x = 'ok' if pizzas[0] == 'Cheese' else 'not ok'\n>>> x\n'not ok'\n\nMake sure your line does not get too long in order not to impair its\nreadability!\n\nPython evaluates a condition and sees whether it is truth-like or not.

Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, True) # Hmm, what is True doing again?\n3\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True) # Aha! Much clearer\n\nAlways having to specify that flag is annoying. It would be much nicer if\nshow had a default value, so that we don’t have to provide a value when\ncalling the method, but can optionally override it.\n>>> def add(x, y, show=False):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2) # No printing!\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True)\n3\n\nPerfect.\nOf course, function arguments can be anything, even other functions!\n>>> def run_method(method, x):\n...     \"\"\"Call `method` with `x`.\"\"\"\n...     return method(x)\n...\n>>> run_method(len, [1, 2, 3])\n3\n\n Methods returning methodsWhat does this method do?\n>>> def make_incrementor(increment):\n...     def func(var):\n...         return var + increment\n...     return func\n\n SolutionClick to expandIt returns a function whose increment value has been filled by the argument\nto make_incrementor. If we called make_incrementor(3), then increment has\nthe value 3, and we can fill in the returned method in our heads.\ndef func(var):\n    return var + 3\n\nSo when we call this method, we’ll get back what we put in, but plus 3.\n>>> increment_one = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> increment_two = make_incrementator(2)\n>>> print increment_one(42), increment_two(42)\n43 44\n>>> print make_incrementator(3)(42) # Do it in one go!\n45\n\n\nWhat if you like to accept an arbitrary number of arguments? For example, we\ncan also write a total method that takes two arguments.\n>>> def total(x, y):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return x + y\n...\n>>>\n\nBut what if we want to allow the caller to pass more than two arguments? It\nwould be tedious to define many arguments explicitly.\n>>> def total(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `*` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(args), args)\n...     return sum(args)\n...\n>>> total(1)\nGot 1 arguments: (1,)\n1\n>>> total(1, 2)\nGot 2 arguments: (1, 2)\n3\n>>> total(1, 2, 3)\nGot 3 arguments: (1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nThe *args syntax says “stuff any arguments into a tuple and call it args”.\nThis let’s us capture any number of arguments. As args is a tuple, one could\nloop over it, access a specific element, and so on.\nWe can also expand lists into separate arguments with the same syntax when\ncalling a method.\n>>> def reverse_args(x, y):\n...     return y, x\n...\n>>> l = ['a', 'b']\n>>> reverse_args(l)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: reverse_args() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)\n>>> reverse_args(*l)\n('b', 'a')\n\nA similar syntax exists for keyword arguments.\n>>> def ages(**people):\n...     \"\"\"Print people's information.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `**` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(people), people)\n...     for person in people:\n...         print 'Person {0} is {1}'.format(person, people[person])\n...\n>>> ages(steve=31)\nGot 1 arguments: {'steve': 31}\nPerson steve is 31\n>>> ages(steve=31, helen=70, zorblax=9963)\nGot 3 arguments: {'steve': 31, 'zorblax': 9963, 'helen': 70}\nPerson steve is 31\nPerson zorblax is 9963\nPerson helen is 70\n\nAs you can see from the debug print statement, **people is a dictionary\ncontaining the keyword arguments we passed to the ages method. The keys of\nthe dictionary are the names of the argument as strings, and the values are the\nvalues of the arguments. Just like for the * syntax, ** can also be used to\nexpand a dictionary into keyword arguments.\n>>> d = {'thor': 5000, 'yoda': -1}\n>>> ages(**d)\nGot 2 arguments: {'yoda': -1, 'thor': 5000}\nPerson yoda is -1\nPerson thor is 5000\n\nThe order of the keyword arguments used to call the method are not necessarily\nthe same as those that the function block sees!\nThis is because dictionaries are unordered, and the ** syntax effectively creates a dictionary.\n The most generic methodThe most generic method would take any number of positional arguments and any\nnumber of keyword arguments. What would this method look like?\n SolutionClick to expandIt would use both * and ** syntax in defining the arguments.\n>>> def generic(*args, **kwargs):\n...     print 'Got args: {0}'.format(args)\n...     print 'Got kwargs: {0}'.format(kwargs)\n...\n>>> d = {'bing': 'baz'}\n>>> generic(1, 2, 'abc', foo='bar', **d)\nGot args: (1, 2, 'abc')\nGot kwargs: {'bing': 'baz', 'foo': 'bar'}\n\n\nInline methods\nSome methods take other methods as arguments, like the built-in map method.\n>>> map(str, range(5))\n['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']\n\nmap takes a function and an iterable, and applies the function to each element in\nthe iterable. It returns a new list with the results. We can define and then pass\nour own functions.\n>>> def cube(x):\n...     \"\"\"Return the third power of x.\"\"\"\n...     return x*x*x\n...\n>>> map(cube, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nFor such a simple method, this is a lot of typing! We can use a lambda function to\ndefine such simple methods inline.\n>>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nThe syntax of defining a lambda is like this:\nlambda : \n is a command-separate set of variables that the lambda can take as\narguments, and  is the code that is run. A lambda\nautomatically returns whatever the result of the expression is, you don’t need\na return (the return is implicit).\nWriting a lambda statement defines a method, which you can capture as a\nvariable just like any other object.\n>>> div2 = lambda x: x/2\n>>> div2\n at 0x7fc6b2207758>\n>>> map(div2, range(5))\n[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n\nNote that we got real numbers back because we are using Python 2 with from __future__ import division.\n Sum in quadratureWrite a method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, and returns the\nsum of the arguments computed in quadrature. A “sum in quadrature” is the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of each number. You should use lambda\nto define a squaring and a square root function, and map to apply the\nsquaring method.\n SolutionClick to expandWe need a little square root method and a method to square its input.\n>>> square = lambda x: x*x\n>>> sqrt = lambda x: x**0.5\n\nWe then define a method that can accept any number of arguments using the\n*args syntax, and use map to call the square method on the list of\narguments. Then we can call sum on the result, and then sqrt.\n>>> def quadrature(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum in quadrature of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return sqrt(sum(map(square, args)))\n...\n>>> quadrature(1, 1) # should be equal to sqrt(2)\n1.4142135623730951\n>>> 2**0.5\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nAnother use case for lambda is the built-in filter method (see:\nhelp(filter)).\n>>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))   # filter and return the even numbers only\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n List comprehensionHow would you rewrite the filter example above using a list comprehension?\n SolutionClick to expand>>> [ x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 ]\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\nGenerally, you should only use lambda methods to define little throw-away\nmethods. The main downside with using them is that you can’t attach a docstring\nto them, and they become unwieldy when there’s complex logic.\n"},"analysis/python/scripting.html":{"url":"analysis/python/scripting.html","title":"Scripting","keywords":"","body":"Scripting\nOK, so we’ve spent quite a long time in Python shells.

To add this, we use for example the sys module, which makes the command line\narguments available as the argv property. We can modify our script to print\nthis out, to get a feeling for what’s going on. We’ll comment out our method\ncall whilst we’re just playing around.\nimport sys\nimport time\n\ndef make_pizza(*toppings):\n    \"\"\"Make a delicious pizza from the toppings.\"\"\"\n    print 'Making pizza...'\n    for topping in toppings:\n        print 'Adding {0}'.format(topping)\n        time.sleep(1)\n    print 'Done!'\n    return 'Pizza with toppings: {0}'.format(toppings)\n\nprint 'sys.argv:', sys.argv\n# pizza = make_pizza('cheese', 'olives')\n\nThen run it:\n$ python pizzaiolo.py\nsys.argv: ['pizzaiolo.py']\n$ python pizzaiolo.py cheese broccoli\nsys.argv: ['pizzaiolo.py', 'cheese', 'broccoli']\n$ python pizzaiolo.py cheese broccoli --help --verbose\nsys.argv: ['pizzaiolo.py', 'cheese', 'broccoli', '--help', '--verbose']\n\nAwesome! sys.argv is just a list with one value per argument (arguments on\nthe command line are separate by spaces).

Actually, that is pretty much all there is to\nthem.\nUsing modules into your code: import\nThe keyword import, usually specified at the beginning of your source code, is\nused to tell Python what modules you want to make available to your current\ncode.\nThere are different ways of specifying an import. The one we have seen already\nsimply makes the module available to you:\n>>> import random\n>>> random.uniform(0, 1)\n0.5877109428927353\n\nThe module random contains functions useful for random number generation: with\nthe import above, we have made the random module accessible, and everything\nwithin that module is accessible via the syntax random.. For the record,\nthe uniform(x,y) method returns a pseudo-random number within the range\n[x,y][x,y][x,y].\nSometimes you want to make only one or more things from a given module\naccessible: Python gives you the ability to import just those:\n>>> from random import uniform, choice\n>>> uniform(0, 1)\n0.4059007502204043\n>>> choice([ 33, 56, 42, -1 ])\n42\n\nIn this case the uniform and choice names are available directly, i.e.\nwithout using the random prefix. All other functions in the random module\nare not available in this case. For the record, the choice function returns a\nrandom element from a given collection.\nAnother option is to import all functions of a certain module and make them\navailable without a prefix:\n>>> from random import *\n>>> gauss(0, 1)\n-1.639334770284028\n\nThis is not that recommended as you generally do not know what is the extent\nof what you are importing and you might end up with name clashes between your\ncurrent code and the imported module, as it will all be in the same namespace,\nmeaning directly available with no need for a . syntax. \nLastly, it is possible to import modules, or specific names from a module,\nunder an alias.\n>>> from random import uniform as uni\n>>> uni(0, 1)\n0.7288973406605329\n>>> import numpy as np\nnp.arccos(1)\n0.0\n\nThis option is useful when you need to assign shorter aliases to names you will\nuse frequently. In particular, the alias np for the numpy module will be\nencountered a lot.\nNote that modules can have submodules, specified with extra dots .:\n>>> from os.path import abspath\n>>> abspath('..')\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d'\n\nWhen importing a module, its submodules are not available by default and you\nmust import them explicitly:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.getcwd()\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d/dberzano'\n>>> import os.path\n>>> os.path.basename(os.getcwd())\n'dberzano'\n\nNote that due to the current Python implementation of the os module, os.path\nfunctions are actually available even without importing os.path. But just\nos. You cannot and should not rely on this implementation, which represents an exception\nand might change in the future. Always import submodules explicitly!\nIt is also possible to import several modules with a single import command:\n>>> import os, sys, math\n\nbut this is not recommended by the Python style guide, which\nsuggests to use several import statements, one per module, as it improves\nreadability:\n>>> import os\n>>> import sys\n>>> import math\n\nIf you need to import several names from a single module, you can split an import\nfunction over multiple lines:\n>>> from math import (\n...     exp,\n...     log,\n...     e,\n...     floor\n... )\n>>> floor(exp(log(e)))\n2.0\n\nThe standard library\nThe set of things that Python comes with, from all of the types of objects to\nall of the different modules, is called the standard library. It is\nrecommended to browse through the standard library documentation to see what is\navailable: Python is rich of standard modules, and you should reuse them as much\nas possible instead of rewriting code on your own.\nSome of the categories for which standard modules are available are:\n\nprocessing paths\ndate and time manipulation\nmathematical functions\nparsing of certain file formats\nsupport for multiple processes and threads\n...\n\nUse standard Python library modules with confidence: being part of any standard\nPython distribution, your code will be easily portable.\nModules from PyPi\nMany external modules can be found on PyPi, the Python Package Index repository.\nSome of those modules are\nalready part of some Python distributions (such as Anaconda, which\ncomes with more than a thousand science-oriented modules preinstalled).\nIf a certain module you need is not available on your distribution you can\neasily install it with the pip shell command. Since you typically do not have write\naccess to the standard Python installation's directories, pip allows you to\ninstall modules only for yourself, under your current user's home directory.\nIt is recommended to set up in your shell startup script (such as ~/.bashrc)\nthe following two lines telling once and for all where to install and search for\nPython user modules:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/.local\nexport PATH=$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\n\nOnce you have done that, close your current terminal window and open a new one,\nand you will be ready to use pip. We will see in a later lesson how to install\nthe root_pandas module with:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nWrite your first Python module\nThe simplest Python module you can write is just a .py file with some\nfunctions inside:\n# myfirstmodule.py\n\ndef one():\n    print('this is my first function')\n\ndef two():\n    print('this is my second function')\n\nYou can now fire an ipython shell and use those functions right away:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nBy simply calling the file myfirstmodule.py we have made it available as a\nmodule named myfirstmodule - given that the file is in the same directory\nwhere we have launched the Python interpreter.\n Module name restrictionsNote that you cannot pick any name you want for a module! From the\n[Python style guide][pep8-modulenames], we gather that we should use \"short,\nall-lowercase names\". As a matter of fact, if we used dashes in the file name,\nwe would have ended up with a syntax error while trying to load it:\n>>> import my-first-module\n  File \"\", line 1\n    import my-first-module\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nPython treats - as a minus and does not understand your intentions.\n\nWrite a structured module\nLet's now create a more structured module, with submodules and different files.\nWe can start from the myfirstmodule.py file and create a directory structure:\n$ mkdir yabba\n$ cp myfirstmodule.py yabba/__init__.py\n\nWe have reused the same file created before, copied it into a directory called\nyabba and renamed it to __init__.py. The double underscore should ring a\nbell: this is a Python special name, and it represents the \"main file\" within\na module, whereas the directory name now represents the module name.\nThis means that our module is called yabba, and if we import it, functions\nfrom __init__.py will be available:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> yabba.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> yabba.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nWe can create an additional file inside the yabba directory, say\nyabba/extra.py and have more functions there:\n# yabba/extra.py\n\ndef three():\n  print 'this function will return the number three'\n  return 3\n\nWe have effectively made extra a submodule of yabba. Let's try:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> filter(lambda x: not x.startswith('__'), dir(yabba))\n['one', 'two']\n>>> import yabba.extra\n>>> yabba.extra.three()\nyabba.extra.three()\nthis function will return the number three\n3\n\n What have I done with the filter function?We have used the filter function above to list the functions we have defined\nin our module. Can you describe in detail what the commands above do?\n SolutionClick to expandThe dir(module) command lists all names (not necessarily functions, not\nnecessarily defined by us) contained in a given imported module. We have used the\nfilter() command to filter out all names starting with two underscores. Every\nitem returned by dir() is passed as x to the lambda function which returns\nTrue or False, determining whether the filter() function should keep or\ndiscard the current element.\n\nRun a module\nWe can make a Python module that can be easily imported by other Python\nprograms, but we can also make it in a way that it can be run directly as a\nPython script.\nLet's write this special module and call it runnable.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nlong_format = False\n\ndef print_label(label, msg):\n    if long_format:\n        out = '{0}: {1}'.format(label.upper(), str(msg))\n    else:\n        out = '{0}-{1}'.format(label[0].upper(), str(msg))\n    print out\n\ndef debug(msg):\n    print_label('debug', msg)\n\ndef warning(msg):\n    print_label('warning', msg)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print '*** Testing print functions ***'\n    debug('This is a debug message')\n    long_format = True\n    warning('This is a warning message with a long label')\nelse:\n    print 'Module {0} is being imported'.format(__name__)\n\nNow let's make it executable:\n$ chmod +x runnable.py\n\nIt can be now run as a normal executable from your shell:\n$ ./runnable.py\n*** Testing print functions ***\nD-This is a debug message\nWARNING: This is a warning message with a long label\nThere are two outstanding notions here. First off, the first line is a\n\"shebang\": it really has to be the first line in a file (it cannot be the\nsecond, or \"one of the first\", or the first non-empty) and it basically tells\nyour shell that your executable text file has to be interpreted by the current\nPython interpreter. Just use this line as it is.\nSecondly, we notice we have a peculiar if condition with a block that gets\nexecuted when we run the file. __name__ is a special internal Python variable\nwhich is set to the module name in case the module is imported. When the module\nis ran, it is set to the special value \"__main__\".\nThe else: condition we have added is just to show what happens when you import\nthe module instead:\n>>> import runnable\nModule runnable is being imported\n>>> runnable.warning('hey I can use it from here too')\nW-hey I can use it from here too\n\nNow, the if condition is not necessary when you want to run the module - those\nlines in the if block will be executed anyway. It is however used to prevent\nsome lines from being executed when you import the file as a module.\nPlease also note that module imports are typically silent, so the else:\ncondition with a printout would not exist in real life.\n"},"analysis/python/learning.html":{"url":"analysis/python/learning.html","title":"Learning more","keywords":"","body":"Learning more\nLearning Python is like learning… well, like learning a language!

Most \nproblems you encounter will already be answered there, and often the answers \nare quite didactic, providing context and further reading, beyond just posting \nthe code that answers the question (these answers aren’t always the ones marked \nas the ‘best answer’, and don’t always have the most votes).\nExploring Python\nThe Python standard library is a treasure-trove of useful objects and methods. \nWe’ve gone through a tiny subset of them here, some others that might be useful \nto you are:\n\nos: Operating system functions to manipulate and query your machine and the \nfile system, like os.mkdir to make directories and os.rename.\ntempfile: create files and directories in a temporary location, like\n/tmp, e.g. tempfile.mkdtemp.\nglob: File name matching, to be able to do things like ls folder/*.txt in \nPython with glob.glob('folder/*.txt').\nsubprocess: Call shell commands with subprocess.call(['ls', '-l', '-a']).\ntime: Get the current time with time.localtime().tm_hour.\ncollections: Use collections.namedtuple to create your own property-only\nobjects.>>> import collections\n>>> Coordinate = collections.namedtuple('Coordinate', ['x', 'y'])\n>>> coord = Coordinate(4.5, 2.0)\n>>> coord.y\n2.0\n>>> x, y = coord\n>>> x\n4.5\n\nUse collections.OrderedDict for ordered dictionaries.>>> d = {'foo': 'bar', 123: 321, 'hero': 'thor'}\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\n123 321\nfoo bar\nhero thor\n>>> d = collections.OrderedDict([('foo', 'bar'), (123, 321)])\n>>> d.update([('hero', 'thor')])\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\nfoo bar\n123 321\nhero thor\n\ncollections.defaultdict is useful for creating dictionaries that will create \nautomatically create values when a previously undefined key is accessed.>>> d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n>>> d['foo'] += 1\n>>> print d, d['foo'], d['bar']\ndefaultdict(, {'foo': 1}) 1 0\n\n\n\nConventional coding\n‘Pythonic code’ is code that follows the conventions of the wider Python \ncommunity. Lots of people write Python, and by following certain stylistic \nconventions it makes it easier for everyone to read each other’s code (as they \nsay: ‘you spend 90% of your time reading code, and 10% writing it’).\nPythonic style emphasises clean, readable code, with consistent formatting and \nuseful comments. The most important thing is to be consistent. You can consult \nPEP8, the official Python style recommendations, if you're unsure or\nwant to settle a dispute like lower_case_functions versus \nupperCaseFunctions. Which of these two methods is easier to read?\nimport time\n\n\ndef myFunc(x,y,verbose = True, fast='yes'):\n    \"\"\"Do the thing.\"\"\"\n    z=( x *y ) /2\n    if verbose == False:\n        print x,y, z\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep( 1 )\n    return  z* z\n\n\ndef my_func(x, y, verbose=True, fast=True):\n    \"\"\"Return ((x*y)/2)**2.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    x, y -- Values used in the computation\n    verbose -- Print computation information\n    fast -- If True, sleep for 1 second before returning\n    \"\"\"\n    z = (x*y)/2\n\n    if verbose:\n        print x, y, z\n    # Should probably remove this functionality\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n    return z*z\n\nThe Zen of Python summarises the ‘philosophy’ that the language tries to \nfollow. See what you think!\n>>> import this\n\n\n“There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it”\n\nIf there isn't, you might be trying to come at a problem the wrong way.\n"},"analysis/python/first_histogram.html":{"url":"analysis/python/first_histogram.html","title":"Making your first histogram","keywords":"","body":"Making your first histogram\nIn this section we are going to make our first plots using Python. For this we\nwill use some public LHCb data for B+→H+H+H− B^+ \\rightarrow H^+ H^+ H^- B​+​​→H​+​​H​+​​H​−​​ from the\nCERN open data portal. This data is available\non EOS:\n$ eos root://eospublic.cern.ch/ ls /eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data\nB2HHH_MagnetDown.root\nB2HHH_MagnetUp.root\nPhaseSpaceSimulation.root\n\n Installing python packagesOne of the best things about Python is the huge number of packages available,\nfor everything from art to machine learning to web development. While LCG\nprovides a lot of useful packages, there are sometimes things missing.\nFortunately, most packages can be easily installed into ~/.local/ using pip\nwith the --user flag. In this lesson we will be using\nroot_pandas, which can\nbe installed using\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nSome packages, such as flake8, provide executables\nwhich are useful to have included on your PATH so they are available without\nspecifying their absolute path. This can be done by running\nexport PATH=$(python -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH\n\nsee the bash lesson for more details about the PATH variable.\nWe can even upgrade already installed packages using:\npip install --user matplotlib --upgrade\n\nAs LCG uses PYTHONPATH to make packages available, any packages it provides\nhave higher priority than the user installed packages. In order to make it so\nthat a package installed with --user takes precedence, you must run\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(python -m site --user-site):$PYTHONPATH\n\nevery time you run the source command above. This is only needed when\ninstalling user packages to upgrade LCG provided ones.\n\nAll ROOT methods made available in Python using a set of automatically generated\nbindings, known as PyROOT.\nThese are all available by using import ROOT.\nFor example if we want to create a TFile using the aforementioned data we can\nlaunch ipython and run:\nIn [1]: import ROOT\nIn [2]: filename = 'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root'\nIn [3]: my_file = ROOT.TFile.Open(filename)\nIn [4]: my_file.ls()\n\nTNetXNGFile**       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n TNetXNGFile*       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n  KEY: TTree    DecayTree;1 Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays\nIn [5]: my_tree = my_file.Get('DecayTree')\nIn [6]: my_tree.Print()\n******************************************************************************\n*Tree    :DecayTree : Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays          *\n*Entries :  5135823 : Total =       945201357 bytes  File  Size =  666480138 *\n*        :          : Tree compression factor =   1.42                       *\n******************************************************************************\nWhile it is very useful to be able to access all the ROOT functionality in this\nway, they are often slow and tedious to use. Luckily people have built more\nspecialised bindings to allow ROOT to be used in a more pythonic way.\nPandas\npandas is a library for doing data analysis on\ntabular data, using a data structure known as dataframes. These typically have\ncolumns with labels (like TLeafs in a TTree) with many rows. The\nroot_pandas package we installed earlier can be used to create a pandas\nDataFrame from a root file:\nIn [7]: import root_pandas\nIn [8]: df = root_pandas.read_root(filename, key='DecayTree')\n\nWe can then use df.head(5) to see the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:\nIn [9]: df.head(5)\nOut[9]:\n   B_FlightDistance  B_VertexChi2        H1_PX        H1_PY          H1_PZ  \\\n0         25.301004      1.497280   375.284205   831.308481   51820.233718\n1         94.690700      1.383338 -4985.130785  5853.750057  326157.454706\n2          8.284490      5.187101 -1265.456544  2330.050788   90762.658032\n3          5.590769      7.129099  -720.797259  3413.790588   86793.058768\n4          3.013242     10.988701   397.754571  1791.373059   40040.364159\n\nWhile it is nice to be able to view the data, it is typically much more useful to\nbe able to apply operations to it in bulk. In this example we have the momentum\ncomponents for each of the child particles in the decay (H1, H2 and H3)\nbut not the transverse momentum. We can however apply expressions to each row\nof the data like so:\nIn [10]: df.eval('sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)')\nOut [10]: 0          1306.642724\n1           167.578904\n2          1273.457019\n3          1146.299204\n             ...\n5135820     210.430531\n5135821     762.344570\n5135822    1454.471057\ndtype: float64\n\nThis gives us the transverse momentum for each particle as an array, however, we\ncan also create a new column with this information by assigning to the name we\nwant to create and doing the action \"inplace\":\nIn [11]: df.eval('H2_PT = sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)', inplace=True)\n\n Adding the total B+ meson momentumCreate a new column in the dataframe called B_P for the total momentum of the\nB+ meson.\n SolutionClick to expanddf.eval('B_P = sqrt('\n        '(H1_PX + H2_PX + H3_PX)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PY + H2_PY + H3_PY)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PZ + H2_PZ + H3_PZ)**2'\n        ')', inplace=True)\n\n\nPlotting histograms\nNow that we have the momentum of the B+B+B+ meson, it would be useful to plot\nits distribution in a histogram. We could use ROOT for this but the most popular Python library for\nplotting is known as matplotlib and this is what we\nwill use here. The most common way matplotlib is used is with the pyplot\ninterface imported as plt like so:\nIn [12]: import matplotlib\nIn [13]: matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Force matplotlib to not use any Xwindows backend.\nIn [14]: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nIn [15]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'])\nIn [16]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance.pdf')\n\n\n Interactive plottingThere are various ways of viewing plots interactively such as:\n\nplt.show() Opens a window with the current plot and pauses the Python\ninterpreter until the window is closed\nplt.ion() Allows plots to be viewed without pausing the Python interpreter\njupyter A web based interface for running various\nlanguages including python in \"notebooks\". If you've used mathematica or\nmatlab before it's a similar interface with code, documentation and plots\nall shown together.\n\n\nIn [17]: import numpy as np\nIn [18]: bins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\nIn [19]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins)\nIn [20]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v2.pdf')\n\n\nThat's not right! The new histogram has been plotted on top of our first one!\nThis is normally useful as it allows us to layer plots on top of each other to\ncompare them. Though in this case we don't want to do that so we should first close\nthe previous plot before making our histogram. We should also add axis labels\nand a legend like so:\nIn [21]: plt.close()  # Close the previous plot\n\nIn [22]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', label='My data label')\nIn [23]: plt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nIn [24]: plt.xlabel('Flight distance of $B^+$ meson')\nIn [25]: plt.legend(loc='best')\nIn [26]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v3.pdf')\n\n\nApplying cuts\nWhen analysing data it is often useful to \"throw away\" some data in order to in\norder change the contributions of a sample. Most commonly this is to remove some\nbackground(s) so we can more precisely study a process of interest. This is\nknown as cutting.\nIn pandas we can apply a cut to a DataFrame using the query method. For\nexample to make a new DataFrame containing B+B^+B​+​​ mesons with flight distances\nof more than 15 mm we can use:\nIn [27]: df_with_cut = df.query('B_FlightDistance > 15')\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsIt is often useful to compare the effect of a cut on the distribution of another\nvariable. Try to plot a histogram showing the B+ lifetime distribution with and\nwithout a total B+ momentum cut of 100000 MeV.\n SolutionClick to expandbins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\ndf_with_cut = df.query('B_P > 100000')\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='Without cut')\nplt.hist(df_with_cut['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='With 100 GeV momentum cut')\n\nplt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nplt.xlabel('Total momentum of $B^+$ meson')\nplt.legend(loc='best')\nplt.savefig('B_flight_distance_with_cut_compare.pdf')\n\nHere we also use the normed=True option with plt.hist, this plots the\nnormalised distribution. This is typically more useful when comparing\ndistributions as it make it easier to see differences in the shape without the\nindependently of the total number of events.\n\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsCalculate and plot the B+ meson mass assuming that all three of the child\nhadrons are kaons.\n\n"},"analysis/python/further_reading.html":{"url":"analysis/python/further_reading.html","title":"Further reading","keywords":"","body":"More advanced topics in Python\nNice standard libraries\n\nargsparse, datetime, fnmatch, glob, os, re, sys, subprocess\n\nNice libraries for data analysis\n\nnumpy, pandas, matplotlib\n\nPython and ROOT\n\npyROOT\nroot_numpy\n\n"},"analysis/best_prac.html":{"url":"analysis/best_prac.html","title":"Part 9 - Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Preparing your code for debug\nIn broad terms when building software you typically have the option between\ngenerating either a release or a debug build.\nThis also applies to ROOT, AliRoot, AliPhysics, and your compiled analysis tasks\nand macros. As the name suggests:\n\nrelease builds are meant for production and should be used when running\nyour code at scale;\ndebug builds should be used exclusively when trying to sort out problems\nin the code.\n\nThere are two main correlated characteristics that differ between release and\ndebug builds:\n\ncompile-time optimization\ndebug symbols\n\nCompile-time optimization\nEvery compiler performs some form of optimization while producing executables\nand libraries. Optimizing a code while compiling means that the compiler does\nnot merely translate a written programming language into machine code, but it\nalso tries to interpret up to a certain extent what the code aims to do.\nAll levels of optimization have the result of avoiding unnecessary code to be\nexecuted, and since optimization requires some code analysis, compilation time\nis longer (even if this is mostly unnoticeable with modern computers).\nDifferent levels of optimization can be choosen, ranging from no optimization\nto aggressive optimization; the most common compilers (for instance, clang\nor gcc) you would use the following switches:\n[-O0|-O1|-O2|-O3|-Ofast|-Os|-Oz|-O|-O4]\nThe default optimization level for the aforementioned compilers is -O2:\nhigher levels of optimization are typically not recommended, as they might alter\nthe program flow to a point it does no longer match any longer the developer's\nintentions.\nA list of what each -O flag enables in GCC is available on the\nGCC documentation.\nWhen debugging code, you want binary instructions generated by the compiler to\nmatch as close as possible the readable code's flow. This is one of the reasons\nwhy optimization should be turned off in such a case.\n\nIncreasing the optimization does not necessarily lead to more efficient code!\n\"Extreme\" optimizations (like -O4) are not recommended and can even lead\nto unexpected results.\n\nSymbols and debug symbols\nShared libraries and executables contain binary code divided into \"sections\",\nand \"symbols\" are a way of referring to such sections. Each function or method\nname of your code is translated into a symbol.\nExtra \"symbols\" are written to a library when compiling in debug mode, pointing\ndirectly fragments of functions to the corresponding lines in the source code.\nTo compile with clang or gcc with debug symbols, you would use the -g\nswitch: there is no guarantee that optimizations are also turned off, so you'd\nbetter specify also -O0:\ngcc -O0 -g ...\n\nThe same flags are used for clang.\nCompiling your ALICE code for debug\nComplex frameworks aren't typically built by directly invoking a compiler and\nits options: for instance, when compiling AliPhysics you use\naliBuild, managing\ndependencies between different packages, and CMake, a\ntool that generates compile commands based on the dependencies between source\nfiles inside the same project.\nA standard aliBuild compilation of AliPhysics, which is as simple as issuing:\naliBuild build AliPhysics\n\nwill use some \"defaults\" which, if no extra option is passed, are read from the\ndefaults-release.sh\nfile. Options\nin this file are such that we compile our three main packages (ROOT, AliRoot and\nAliPhysics) using both a normal optimization level (-O2) and debug symbols\n(-g).\n\nThe default configuration is sufficient in most cases and it is the same used\nfor Grid packages.\n\nYou have the option to use a different set of \"defaults\" for debug (note that\nthis will trigger a full recompilation of most packages):\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults debug\n\nSuch debug configuration uses -O0 and -g.\nYour analysis\nSuppose your analysis task is called AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask. In the macro\nyou use to load the analysis task, you can do:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask.cxx++g\");\n\nThe \"double plus\" forces recompilation, while the appended g tells ROOT to\ncompile the task with debug symbols. Once your code is in production, just\nremove the g:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask.cxx++\");\n\nPlease note that debug code is considerably slower than production code,\nalthough it provides you with more information (for instance line numbers in\nstacktraces as we will see later).\n\nOnly use debug builds for temporary tests: turn off debugging when\nsending your code to production!\n\nGot Debug Symbols? (Linux only)\nTo check if your code has been compiled with debug symbols, on Linux you can\ndo:\nnm -a libName.so | grep debug\n\nThe nm -a command lists all symbols: we grep only the ones containing the\nword \"debug\". For instance:\n$> cd $ALICE_BUILD/lib/tgt_*\n$> objdump --syms libPWGEMCAL.so\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_aranges    0000000000000000              .debug_aranges\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_info    0000000000000000              .debug_info\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_abbrev  0000000000000000              .debug_abbrev\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_line    0000000000000000              .debug_line\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_str     0000000000000000              .debug_str\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_loc     0000000000000000              .debug_loc\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_ranges  0000000000000000              .debug_ranges\n\nThe library libPWGEMCAL.so on our reference Linux installation does\ncontain debug symbols. The above command usually contains no output if no\ndebug symbols are present.\nPlease note that on macOS debug symbols do not show up with nm -a.\nSome general programming tips\nIn order to reduce as much as possible the amount of time spent debugging and\nmaking your code faster, here are some general tips you might find useful.\nUse existing algorithms for general problems\nA large portion of coding problems applied to data collections can be reduced\nto sorting or searching: even if a simple custom made array sorting\ncode looks innocuous and easy to read, when iterating over a collection of\nthousands or millions of elements its drawbacks become pretty obvious.\nAs a general rule, do not write your own sorting algorithms: standard ROOT\ndata collections, like TLists and\nTObjArrays, already have an\nefficient Sort() method.\nMoreover, if you are manually filling a TList for sorting it at a later time,\nconsider using something like the\nTSortedList, which is\ncompatible with a TList, i.e. you can do:\nTList *mySortedList = new TSortedList();\n\nbut objects are inserted in the correct order every time you Add() them,\navoiding additional time waste to order it at a later time.\nThe same considerations apply for searching algorithms: ROOT already have\nsearch functions optimized for its data structures, and if you search in a\nsorted list (like the TSortedList), search is faster.\nSearching by strings inside large collections must be avoided at all times:\nstring comparison is a very expensive operation, and it is not easy to estimate\nhow long it takes since it depends on the length of the compared strings.\nMassive string comparison, even if this is unobvious, leads to:\n\nlarge data transfers between CPU, caches and memory, hitting the bus\nlimits\ncache trashing, i.e. the constant invalidation of the caches that are\nsupposed to speed up code execution\n\nA bad example that uses massively string comparisons has been found inside ROOT\nthanks to the IgProf profiler, and the code has been amended, as we will see\nlater on.\nTo improve lookups in large collections, please consider\nTHashList instead of TList: a\n\"hash\" is a fixed-size byte sequence (usually an integer) associated to each\nelement and computed based on the content of the element, constituting a sort\nof \"fingerprint\".\nWhen performing a lookup on a hash list (i.e. find what element is identical\nto this one, or find what element has this name), the hash (\"fingerprint\") of\nthe input element is calculated, and it is compared with the hash of every\nother element in the list.\nIf two hashes match, it might mean that the two elements are identical: in\nthis case, and this case only, a deep check is performed and the response is\nreturned.\nThe big advantage is that from a shallow (hash) comparison we can tell for sure\nif two elements are different, which saves us the time required to perform a\ndeep comparison for every element.\n\nUse optimized versions of the algorithms even if they are difficult to\nunderstand, and trust them!\n\nFor a list of optimized general purpose algorithms in C and C++, have a look at\nthe Numerical Recipes, which is considered the \"sacred\ntext\" of this field.\nObject ownership\nVery often, the ownership of pointers is not clear, i.e. who created a\ncertain object, and who is responsible of garbage collecting it?\nIf you are the person defining a new object, be sure to do something like:\nAliMyObject *mo = new AliMyObject();\n// code code code\ndelete mo;\n\nYou have probably heard it lots of times already, but it is worth repeating it:\nwrite a delete every time you write a new, and think in advance of how to\ndispose of an object you created.\nROOT collections (i.e. the TLists) can be made \"owners\" of objects:\nTList *l = new TList();\nl->SetOwner(kTRUE);\n// add add add\ndelete l;\n\nThis means that when the code reaches the delete line, delete is\nautomatically invoked on each of the contained objects, so that you do not have\nto do it manually.\nNew and delete, and hidden memory operations\nPlease note that new and delete operations are very slow: never ever create\nand destroy an object per loop (for instance inside the UserExec() of the\nanalysis tasks)!\n\nSave memory and CPU, recycle objects! And if the object classes\nare defined by you, write them in a way that you can redefine\ntheir content without the need to delete and recreate them!\n\nA bad example with objects constructed per loop:\nfor (x=0; x\nEven if new and delete are not used there (objects are on the stack), the\nTLorentzVectors have their constructor and destructor invoked per loop!\nThe amended code:\nTLorentzVector vec1;\nTLorentzVector vec2;\nTLorentzVector res;\n\nfor (x=0; x\nAs you can see, the\nTLorentzVector has various Set*() methods that make it not necessary to\ndestroy and recreate the object to set new coordinates.\nAlso, do not be too zealous when deleting: in particular, do not delete\nobjects that do not belong to you.\n\nCommon example: do not delete the object if you get its pointer from a\nTDirectory (like a TFile)!\n\nChoose the ROOT container carefully: even if a TList and a TObjArray are\nboth collections capable of expanding, lists are sparse in memory, as each\nelement points to the next (and sometimes to the previous); instead, arrays\nare contiguous collections of elements in memory.\nGrowing an array requires periodic hidden realloc() low level operations\n(luckily they do not happen for every element we add), and this might be rather\nimpairing when applied to a very large collection: use a TList in such a\ncase.\nROOT I/O and objects\nA note about ROOT objects (i.e. objects inheriting from TObject, i.e.\nmost likely your own objects): ROOT as you know needs a default constructor\nfor I/O that takes no arguments. You should create at least two\nconstructors in your code for clarity:\n\nThe default one, needed by ROOT, that should be called only by ROOT when\nstoring or restoring object from a file, and should never be used by the\nprogrammer directly: do not write any memory allocation instruction there,\nleave it as empty as possible!\nThe \"explicit\" one, taking at least one argument, which should do the actual\nstuff and should be used by the programmer when creating a new object.\n\nHistograms or trees obtained from a file with statements like:\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\n\nare related to the corresponding TFile, and they are destroyed when the\nfile is closed. So, do not do that:\nTFile *myFile = TFile::Open(\"myfile.root\");\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\ndelete myFile;\nhisto->Draw();\n\nThis is because TFile owns the pointer. You can detach the histogram from\nthe file:\nTFile *myFile = TFile::Open(\"myfile.root\");\ngROOT->cd();\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\ndelete myFile;\nhisto->Draw();\n\nbut in this case you own the histogram and you must dispose of it:\n// when done...\ndelete histo;\n\nNote that you could also use histo->SetDirectory(0) for being able to close\nthe file, but it is better to attach it to the \"ROOT root directory\" in order\nto use it for instance in TTree::Draw.\nPlease note that there are in particular two objects that are automatically\nassociated to a TFile, mostly for performance reasons:\n\nHistograms (i.e. all objects inheriting from TH1)\nTrees (i.e. all objects inheriting from TTree, including the TNtuple)\n\nFor those categories of objects, the corresponding TFile owns the object. You\nmust always disassociate the object from the originating TFile if you\nwant to keep the object while closing the file.\n\nThis does not apply for objects that are neither histograms nor trees: in\nthat case (e.g a TList or a TGraph) you are responsible of\ndisposing of the object.\n\nCompiler warnings\nDo not overlook compiler warnings! Warnings should never exist in a\nclean code.\nWhenever you see a warning, you have to:\n\nfix the code, if it is actually broken: sometimes warnings get it right\nthat you are doing something wrong\nsilence the warning by rewriting the snippet in a way that it does not\ntrigger the warning.\n\nDifferent compilers give different warnings: clang is usually more precise and\ntends to give you advice on either how to silence the warning, or what you\nprobably meant when writing the code. Of course a compiler is a \"stupid\" piece\nof software and you should not always follow literally its advice, but do not\noverlook it!\nTwo good examples clarifying why warnings should not be ignored:\n\nStarting from GCC 5 many former warnings are turned into errors by default. We\nhave evaluated the opportunity to pass GCC 5 some flags to maintain the legacy\nbehavior (i.e. revert some errors into warnings) but we have found out that\nthe compiler was right: those warnings were actually faulty code that needed\nto be fixed. If the authors checked the warnings in the first place they would\nhave for sure recognized the logic errors in the code.\nWarnings clog compilation output and make more difficult to detect actual\nerrors when they occur.\n\nNote that by default aliBuild conceals the compilation output. You need to pass\nthe --debug option to actually see the warnings popping up:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --debug\n\nWhen to use pointers\nAs a general rule, it is not always a good idea to use pointers to objects as\ndata members of your class. If objects are big you are forced to use it, but\nfor many small objects you'd better use the object directly: you will save\nyourself (and the computer) a new/delete operation for each one of them. This\nhas an impact if you have many small objects.\nRemember to always initialize pointers used as data members: compilers should\nraise warnings if you do not.\nMany member pointers in custom classes are transient, i.e. they should\nexist only in memory and they should not be written to a file.  So please mark\nevery transient pointer with the appropriate special ROOT comment //! (no\nspaces between the slash and exclamation mark):\nclass MyClass : public TObject {\n  private:\n    AnotherClass *transient_ptr;  //!\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nThis comment is not just a decorator: you are telling ROOT not to save the\npointer to file, considerably reducing the output size!\n\nStrings\nA very very very bad habit found very frequently in analysis code is\nreferencing objects via their name inside the UserExec() (or any other loop):\nTH1I *h = list->FindObject(\"myHistoName\");\n\nThe FindObject() function is very (very!) expensive, furthermore it always\nreturns the same pointer for a certain object: it surely makes no sense to run\nit inside the UserExec()! Do this call once during the initialization and\nuse the cached result in the event loop!\nAlso, avoid passing \"raw\" strings as arguments to functions. Don't do:\nvoid MyClass::myfunc(TString a) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nDo instead:\nvoid MyClass::myfunc(const TString &a) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nNote that in both cases you invoke it with:\nmyfunc(\"this is a string\");\n\nwhich means that you can update your code without changing the way you call\nsuch functions.\nMoreover, it is a bad idea to use strings as triggering options on a method,\nlike:\nvoid MyClass::dosomething(const TString &what) {\n  if (what == \"this\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == \"that\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == \"something else\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nAs we have seen, string comparison is evil. Use enums instead:\nenum dowhat_t { THIS, THAT, SOMETHING_ELSE };\n\nvoid MyClass::dosomething(const dowhat_t what) {\n  if (what == THIS) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == THAT) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == SOMETHING_ELSE) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nThe code is as readable, but much more efficient.\nWhere does my code crash?\nWhen the code you are running \"crashes\", you are usually presented with a\nbacktrace or stack trace showing the nesting level of the called\nfunctions plus some more or less \"obscure\" information.  Such backtrace can be\nmore detailed if you have compiled your code with debug symbols.\nConsider the following backtrace:\n *** Break *** segmentation violation\n Generating stack trace...\n

defined in\nlibCore.5.so and the crash occurred at byte offset 317 calculated from the\nstart of the compiled function inside the binary library.\nThe difference in debug information is given by the fact that:\n\nAliRoot has been compiled with debug information: all AliRoot functions\nreport the corresponding source file and line number\nROOT has been compiled without debug information: all ROOT functions only\nreport obscure offsets\n\n\nIt is possible to mix non-debug and debug code, but we will obtain\ncomprehensible information only for the latter.\n\nIn the following sections we will present two commonly used debugging\ntechniques: one very simple based on printouts, and another one based on using\na debugger (gdb).\nDebugging with \"printf/cout\"\nThe simplest way to understand what goes on in your code is to introduce\nperiodic printouts stating the value of some variables, or simply indicating\nwhat the program is currently executing.\nPlease note that, while printouts may be useful, they surely clutter your code\nif abused: so if you end up adding one printout per code line, you'd better off\nwith a debugger, as explained in the next paragraph.\nApart from code cleanliness, printouts have a computational cost, which might\nbe non-negligible depending on the frequency of your output: we are about to\nlearn the appropriate way to add discrete debug printouts to your code in a\nway that:\n\nwe can turn them off when debug is over without additional computational costs\nwe don't have to write our code twice, one debug and one production version\n\nThe generic way\nThe simplest (and naive) way to do it in C/C++ is the following:\n// global variable\nbool gPrintDebug = true;\n\nvoid PrintDebug(const char *message) {\n  if (gPrintDebug == false)\n    return;\n  std::cout \nThe above snippet has a convenient PrintDebug() function, whose output can be\nsuppressed by simply setting the global variable gPrintDebug = false.\nHowever, the PrintDebug() function is called in any case, even if no output\nwill be produced, and this function call has a non-negligible cost; moreover,\nthe condition if (!gPrintDebug) must be tested every time, which has another\ncomputational cost.\nThe correct way is to use C/C++ preprocessor macros. The simplest way is to\nmove the condition if (!gPrintDebug) from C++ to the preprocessor:\n#include \n\n//#define PRINT_DEBUG\n\n#ifdef PRINT_DEBUG\nvoid PrintDebug(const char *message) {\n  std::cout \nIf we compile the above snippet, no call to the print function will ever be\ngenerated in the compiled code, because the condition is evaluated at compile\ntime by the code preprocessor (to be precise, this happens just before\ncompiling the code).\nTo enable print debug, you can either uncomment the #define line on top, or\ncompile the code with:\ngcc -o prog -D PRINT_DEBUG prog.cxx\n\ni.e. you can define the PRINT_DEBUG preprocessor variable on the command\nline without modifying your code.\n\nThere are fancier ways to use preprocessor macros for debug: this\none is trivial and provided as an example.\n\nThe AliRoot way: AliDebug\nAliRoot has a logging facility defined in STEER/STEERbase/AliLog.{h,cxx}:\nthere are different functions defined there that allow you to add sensible\nprintouts to your code, and you should definitely use them instead of cout or\nprintf.\nThe \"functions\" are preprocessor macros, and there is a variable associated to\neach of them, determining whether the code for the printout should be generated\nor not ar runtime:\n\n\n\nFunction\nVariable\n\n\n\n\nAliDebug(level, message)\nLOG_NO_DEBUG\n\n\nAliInfo(message)\nLOG_NO_INFO\n\n\nAliWarning(message)\nLOG_NO_WARNING\n\n\nAliError(message)\nnone\n\n\nAliFatal(message)\nnone\n\n\n\nBy defining the LOG_NO_* variables (through #define, for instance) it is\npossible to suppress all the related message outputs, but in a way that the\ngenerated code is optimized as explained in the previous paragraph.\nPlease note that:\n\nit is not possible to suppress error and fatal error messages\nyou must use those macros in a class\nyou must include AliLog.h for using them\nyou can turn them on and off selectively per class\n\nConsider the following minimal example (save it as AliLogTest.h):\n//#define LOG_NO_INFO\n#include \"AliLog.h\"\n\nclass AliLogTest : public TObject {\n  public:\n    AliLogTest() {\n      AliInfoF(\"I am %s\", \"legend\");\n    };\n  ClassDef(AliLogTest, 1);\n};\n\nLoad it via the following load.C macro:\n{\n  gSystem->AddIncludePath(\"-I$ALICE_ROOT/include\");\n  gROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliLogTest.h++\");\n  AliLogTest a;\n}\n\nRun:\naliroot -q load.C\n\nand see what happens if you uncomment the LOG_NO_INFO definition.\nPlease note that in the example above we have used a function called\nAliInfoF() (and not AliInfo()): this is not a typo.\nEach one of the aforementioned log functions has a *F version (where \"F\" is\nfor \"formatting\"), accepting the same arguments of printf (for instance, %s\nfor strings or %d for signed integers). The following two calls produce the\nsame output:\nAliInfoF(\"The goat sleeps %s\", \"on the bench\");\nAliInfo(Form(\"The goat sleeps %s\", \"on the bench\"));\n\nbut they do different things. The AliInfoF() function roughly\ntranslates to:\n// AliInfoF(message, ...)\n{\n  TString formattedMessage;\n  formattedMessage.Form(message, ...);\n  AliInfo( formattedMessage );\n}\n\nwhich allocates a TString object used as a buffer for formatting the string.\nThe Form() call, instead, uses a preallocated common circular buffer of a\ncertain, uncontrollable size: so, AliInfoF() is safer if you have to\nformat very very long strings and you fear you might overwrite the buffer or\nget your part of the buffer overwritten by something else.\n\nOn single core programs, no one overwrites your buffer before you print it\nout: you might have problems with multithreading.\n\nIn general, using the full AliInfo(Form()) is better as it does not\ncreate and destroy an object, which is costly. If you do not want to use the\ncircular buffer but also don't want to create a buffer for each call, you can\nalso allocate your own buffer once and reuse it:\nTString myBuffer;\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 1) );\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 2) );\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 3) );\n\nPlease also note that the LOG_NO_INFO define has the effect of suppressing\nalso the code generation for whatever the argument of AliInfo() is. So, if\nyou have:\n#define LOG_NO_INFO\n#include \"AliLog.h\"\n// ...\nAliInfo( Form(\"something %s, something %s\", \"borrowed\", \"blue\") );\n\nthe Form() code will not be generated.\nAs a general rule:\n\nuse AliInfo( Form() )\nrevert to a shared buffer, or AliInfoF() if you get garbled output\n\n\nChoose AliInfo() or AliInfoF() according to your needs, but be\naware of what they do under the hood!\n\nChoosing a \"debug level\"\nAliLog allows you to set the \"importance\" of your debug message, which is\ncalled the debug level: depending on the settings, you can decide to only\nprint important messages, i.e. messages with a debug level equal or greater\nthan whatever you decide.\nDebug messages are printed using AliDebug(), and the corresponding\nAliDebugF() function for printf-formatted messages. Syntax:\nAliDebug(level, message);\nAliDebugF(level, formatstring, [arg1[, arg2...]]);\n\nlevel is a positive integer setting the debug level: greater means\n\"more important\".\nThe global debug level is used to decide which messages to print.\nUse:\nAliLog::SetGlobalDebugLevel(level);\n\nOnly messages with a level greater than or equal to level will be\nprinted out.\nThe SetGlobalDebugLevel function is a static function, so you\nshould literally use it prefixed by AliLog::.\nUsing a debugger\ngdb is the GNU debugger. To install it on\nDebian-based distributions (like Ubuntu):\napt update\napt install gdb\n\ngdb and OS X\nSince some time, OS X moved to LLVM. In general, code compiled with LLVM\ncompilers cannot be debugged easily with gdb, although it is claimed now and\nthen to be compatible.\nLLVM comes with a new debugger called lldb: for the\nbasic operations, lldb's commands and its way of funcitoning are very similar,\nif not identical in some cases, to gdb.\nThe debugging example that follows contains examples and references to both gdb\nand lldb, and enough information on how to use the latter if you come from gdb.\nJust for reference,\nhere's how to install gdb on OS X\nproperly.\n\nIt is recommended you get accustomed with lldb if you use a Mac, and refrain\nfrom using gdb, as it lacks official support.\n\nTest case: a program that crashes\nConsider the following snippet:\n#include \n\n#define FLOAT_ARY 12\n\nvoid crash_function() {\n  unsigned int answer_to_everything = 42;\n  int another_number = -answer_to_everything;\n  float many_floats[FLOAT_ARY];\n  int counter_max = 10000;\n  const char *test_string = \"oh no, not again!\";\n  std::cout \n\nName it crash.cxx and compile it with debug symbols. On Linux:\ng++ -g -O0 -o crash crash.cxx\n\nOn OS X:\nclang++ -g -O0 -o crash crash.cxx\n\nThis code contains an array of floats, allocated \"on the stack\" (i.e. on the\nfunction's memory), which has space for 12 elements:\nfloat many_floats[12];\n\nHowever in the for loop we are writing way beyond its length in order to\nartificially generate a crash. Let's run it:\n$> ./crash\n...\nsetting index 811 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 812 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 813 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 814 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 815 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 816 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nSegmentation fault: 11\n\nThe program crashes at a random point as expected.\n\nWe did not obtain any stack trace automatically: this is a peculiarity of\nROOT programs.\n\nWe want to run the program under a debugger in order to:\n\nobtain a stack trace\nsee the value of the variables at the moment of the crash\n\nLoad the program under gdb:\ngdb --args ./crash\n\nOn OS X you might use lldb:\nlldb -- ./crash\n\nFrom the gdb or lldb prompt, run the program by typing run: when the program\ncrashes, we are back at the debugger's prompt.\nHere is the sample output from lldb (gdb's output is very similar):\n* thread #1: tid = 0x13c1d0, 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7fff5fc00000)\n    frame #0: 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14\n   11        std::cout  14          many_floats[i] = 0.12345;\n   15        }\n   16        std::cout The debugger is pointing us exactly to the line where the execution has\nstopped: since we have compiled the program with debug symbols, we have this\nprecise reference and the debugger can even show us the code snippet.\nTo manually show the code snippet, type list (both gdb and lldb).

With lldb:\nbreakpoint set -b func1\nWith gdb:\nbreak func1\nOr, as an alternative, we can set the breakpoint to a certain line of code.\nWith lldb:\n$> breakpoint set -l 28\nBreakpoint 1: where = crash`func1() + 15 at crash.cxx:28, address = 0x0000000100000f9f\n\nWith gdb:\n$> break set 28\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x100000f9f: file crash.cxx, line 28.\n\nNow run the program with run. It will stop where we told it to stop, even if\nit did not crash: since the execution is stopped, we can do many things:\n\nexamine the variables\nadvance line by line\nresume the normal execution\ndelete the breakpoint\n\nFor instance, we set the breakpoint before incrementing the variable\na_variable of one unit: let's print its value:\n$> print a_variable\n$0 = 456\n\nProcess next line with next, or simply n, then examine again:\n$> n\n$> print a_variable\n$1 = 457\n\nThe variable was correctly incremented by one unit like expected.

They are very\nheavy for production operations.\n\nLightweight profiling with IgProf\nIgProf, the Ignominious Profiler, is a performance and\nmemory profiling tool.\n\"Profiling an application\" means finding the application's hotspots:\n\nin what functions the program spends most of the time\nwhat parts of the code do the most memory operations\n\nOne might want to perform profiling either because the application appears to\nbe slower than expected: in this case, profiling aims to answer the question:\nwhere does my program waste more time?\nFor general optimization reasons, profiling is useful to understand what parts\nof the code are worth optimizing: for instance, a very slow initialization part\nthat takes 10 seconds on a long job that lasts for hours is not worth\noptimizing.\nThere are several profilers already used with success: for instance, Valgrind's\nmemcheck and callgrind tools.\nIgProf and Valgrind have different scopes and very different ways of working.\nFirst of all, Valgrind is a deterministic tool, while IgProf is\nstatistic. Valgrind runs your code in a special internal virtual machine\nthat traps every single function call and memory operation: the final report\nwill be very precise, but the code execution might take up to 40 times more.\nOn the other hand, IgProf just monitors externally the profiled program: it\nperiodically (with a high frequency) asks the system what is the currently\nexecuting function of a certain program. The advantages of this approach are:\n\ncode runs at native speed and optimized for the real architecture:\nthere is no Valgrind virtual machine slowing down\nno debugging symbols are needed, i.e. you do not need to compile with -g\n\n\nAs a matter of fact \"debug\" options should be off when running IgProf, as the\ntool aims to profile production builds as they are.\n\nOf course, the big disadvantage is that the final report, being only statistic,\nwill be more imprecise than Valgrind's: but the idea is that, for programs that\ntake a long time to complete (like our physics analyses), IgProf might miss the\nleast called functions, but its precision on the most called functions is very\nclose to Valgrind's.\nIn practice, IgProf is considered much more efficient than Valgrind when\nattempting to optimize code with a long running time for a certain\narchitecture.\n\nBeware! It is not implied that IgProf is a replacement of Valgrind: it is\ninstead a lightweight alternative to it for a limited and specific number of\ncases.\n\nInstalling IgProf on Ubuntu\nIgProf is not available on OS X. To install it on Ubuntu 14.04, here\nis a slightly modified version of the\nofficial installation recipe:\nmkdir -p $ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/src\ncd $ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/src\n\nIGPROF_VERSION=5.9.10\nLIBATOMIC_VERSION=7.2alpha4\nLIBUNWIND_VERSION=1.0.1\n\nDownload and unpack:\nwget http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/download/libatomic_ops-$LIBATOMIC_VERSION.tar.gz\nwget http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/libunwind/libunwind-$LIBUNWIND_VERSION.tar.gz\nwget -Oigprof-$IGPROF_VERSION.tar.gz https://github.com/ktf/igprof/archive/v$IGPROF_VERSION.tar.gz\n\nfor f in *.tar.gz ; do tar xzf $f ; done\n\nBuild the three components. libatomic:\ncd libatomic_ops-$LIBATOMIC_VERSION\n./configure --prefix=$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof\nmake -j$MJ install\ncd ../\n\nlibunwind:\ncd libunwind-$LIBUNWIND_VERSION\n./configure \\\n  CPPFLAGS=\"-I$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/include -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE\" \\\n  CFLAGS=\"-g -O3\" \\\n  --prefix=$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof --disable-block-signals\nmake -j$MJ install\ncd ../\n\nTo install IgProf, you need libpcre3-dev and cmake:\napt install libpcre3-dev cmake\n\nBuild it (a small patching is needed to the CMakeLists.txtfile):\ncd igprof-$IGPROF_VERSION\nsed -e 's/-Werror//g' -i CMakeLists.txt\ncmake \\\n  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof \\\n  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO=\"-g -O3\" \\\n  -DUNWIND_INCLUDE_DIR=$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/include \\\n  -DUNWIND_LIBRARY=$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/lib\nmake -j$MJ\nmake install\ncd ../\n\nRunning IgProf\nAssuming that IgProf and libunwind are installed under $IGPROF_PREFIX, you\nneed to set the following environment:\nexport PATH=\"$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/bin:$PATH\"\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$ALICE_PREFIX/igprof/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\n\nIf everything is OK, igprof should be in the path:\n$> which igprof\n/home/ubuntu/alice/igprof/bin/igprof\n\nSuppose you normally launch your AliRoot macro like this:\naliroot -b -q myTestMacro.C++\n\nIt is very easy to run it under the IgProf performance profiler:\nigprof -pp -z -o myTestMacro.pp.gz aliroot -b -q myTestMacro.C++\n\nIn this case:\n\nwe are using the performance profiler (-pp)\noutput data will be compressed (-z)\noutput data will be saved to myTestMacro.pp.gz (-o)\n\nWhen the process has finished, launch the following command to produce a parsed\ntext output:\nigprof-analyse -v -g myTestMacro.pp.gz > myTestMacro.pp.txt\n\nInterpreting IgProf data\nThe resulting text file contains information on the absolute and relative\namount of time spent inside each function. It is composed of two main sections:\n\na cumulative timing part, indicated by `Flat profile (cumulative\n= ...%)`, where each percentage takes into account the time spent inside that\nfunction and in all functions invoked by it;\n\n\na self timing part, indicated by Flat profile (self >= ...%), where the\ntime spent in the functions called by the current function are not taken into account.\n\nThere is another third section highlighting the stack calls for each entry of\nthe first two tables.\nThe following example is taken from a profiling performed on the ROOT hadd\nexecutable for merging histograms in different files to a single output. Test\nconditions:\n\n984 ROOT files\n10000 TH1F histograms\n100 bins per histogram\n\nThe self profiling data is presented below:\nFlat profile (self >= 0.01%)\n\n% total       Self  Function\n  23.60      23.46  __strcmp_ssse3 [23]\n  19.67      19.55  TDirectoryFile::GetKey(char const*, short) const [21]\n  10.77      10.70  TListIter::Next() [24]\n   3.92       3.90  TNamed::GetName() const [35]\n   3.02       3.00  inflate [26]\n   2.79       2.78  inflate_table [45]\n   2.16       2.14  inflate_fast [54]\n   2.14       2.13  __read_nocancel [55]\n   2.04       2.02  TList::FindObject(char const*) const [37]\n   1.40       1.39  __strcmp_ssse3 [69]\n   0.77       0.77  _init [84]\n...\nWhat we notice is that about a quarter of the total running time is spent\ninside the __strcmp_ssse3 function, which performs string comparison. Another\nconsistent percentage is spent in the GetKey() method of ROOT, used to obtain\nthe key in a file corresponding to a certain object name.\nThe result is astonishing, as we do not expect string comparison to be the\nheaviest part of our merging code.\nNext to __strcmp_ssse3 there is a [23] indication, that points to the\nrelevant stack trace portions:\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nRank    % total       Self       Self / Children   Function\n           58.7  .........      58.34 / 62.09        TDirectoryFile::WriteTObject(TObject const*, char const*, char const*, int) [20]\n[21]       58.7      58.34      19.55 / 38.79      TDirectoryFile::GetKey(char const*, short) const\n           22.7  .........      22.57 / 23.46        __strcmp_ssse3 [23]\n           10.4  .........      10.37 / 10.70        TListIter::Next() [24]\n            3.8  .........       3.76 / 3.90         TNamed::GetName() const [35]\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n            0.9  .........       0.90 / 3.29         TList::FindObject(char const*) const [37]\n           22.7  .........      22.57 / 58.34        TDirectoryFile::GetKey(char const*, short) const [21]\n[23]       23.6      23.46      23.46 / 0.00       __strcmp_ssse3\nThis is useful to understand what called the string comparison: from the\nstack trace, we notice that GetKey() calls it, and it is in turn called by\nthe public function TList::FindObject(). GetKey() is also invoked by\nWriteTObject().\nNow, when merging data from different files, objects with the same name are\nmerged, and they have to be looked by using the FindObject() function: by\nblindly profiling the code, we have understood what is the part of the code\nwhere it is worth starting the optimization.\nThe string comparison function is provided by the system, and it is already\nheavily optimized: the code has been then optimized by trying to avoid\ncalling the string comparison as much as possible during the lookup of objects.\nIn this case, the optimization consisted in using a hash table instead of using\na list for storing objects. When performing a string lookup, hashes of the\ncurrent string and precomputed hashes of each element are compared: since they\nare numbers, the comparison is much faster.\nIf hashes match, it does not mean that strings match, as hashes have less\ndegrees of freedom than strings: only in the case they match, an actual string\ncomparison is performed.\nAfter the optimization (committed in ROOT), here is the relevant part of the\nself profile:\nFlat profile (self >= 0.01%)\n\n% total       Self  Function\n   8.86       3.20  inflate [21]\n   8.68       3.14  inflate_table [31]\n   5.74       2.07  inflate_fast [42]\n   4.98       1.80  TList::FindObject(char const*) const [32]\n   3.01       1.09  __read_nocancel [64]\n   2.41       0.87  TH1::Merge(TCollection*) [30]\n...\nThe string comparison has completely disappeared, and now other functions take\nmost of the time. In the above example, the inflate functions are used\nbecause ROOT files are compressed, and the calls to FindObject() have already\nbeen optimized.\nIn a couple of hours we were able to:\n\nprofile an unknown code\nunderstand where it spends the majority of its time\noptimize the relevant part\n\nPerformance profiling on macOS\nAs we have said, IgProf is not available on macOS. However, Xcode includes an\nexcellent graphical tool called\nInstruments:\nif you have installed Xcode, open it, then go to the menu Xcode > Open\nDeveloper Tool > Instruments.\nA main menu is presented: the Time Profiler tool can be used to sample a\nrunning process and to obtain an interactive and browsable profile.\n\nProfiles obtained with IgProf and Instruments are very similar, and the\nconsiderations on interpreting and optimizing are valid for both tools.\nValgrind\nValgrind is a complex and robust tool to perform code\nanalysis and profiling.\nValgrind is composed of many tools, each one of them performing a different\ntask. The two tools we are interested in are:\n\nmemcheck: the memory checker\ncallgrind: a performance profiler\n\nInstalling Valgrind on Ubuntu is easy:\napt install valgrind\n\nOn OS X it is easy as well. With Homebrew:\nbrew install valgrind\n\nMemory check\nMemory checks with Valgrind are useful to find the following memory\nproblems:\n\ninvalid memory reads\ninvalid memory writes\npotential memory leaks\n\nValgrind will indicate the potential problems in the logfile it\nproduces. Since it can be hard to understand the logfile, there are\nalso graphical tools showing:\n\nmemory trends (with respect to running time): useful to see when and\nhow the memory grows\nallocation peaks: useful to see which are the parts of your code\nmaking the most memory allocations\n\nWe recommend using the massif-visualizer tool. On Ubuntu 14.04, it can be\ninstalled by\ngetting it from the Kubuntu repositories:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install massif-visualizer\nRun your program under Valgrind's memory check. The following command\nis suitable for AliRoot (see man valgrind for more details):\nvalgrind \\\n  --tool=memcheck \\\n  --error-limit=no \\\n  --max-stackframe=3060888 \\\n  --suppressions=$ROOTSYS/etc/valgrind-root.supp \\\n  --leak-check=no \\\n  --num-callers=40 \\\n  --log-file=/tmp/valgrind_memory.log \\\n  aliroot -b -q launchMyAnalysis.C+\n\nA couple of notes.\n\nThe --suppressions switch is used to tell Valgrind which alleged\nmemory problems to ignore. The file we pass to it is the ROOT\nsuppressions file, and greatly simplifies the produced output by\nreducing false positives.\nThe --leak-check=no makes the execution much faster, but it does\nnot check for memory leaks. Use --leak-check=full for a deeper\ninspection, but expect a longer running time.\n\n\nValgrind traps all memory operations through an internal \"virtual\nmachine\": this is why it can be up to 40 times slow. Run your\nprogram under Valgrind on a very small dataset!\n\nTo produce data readable with the massif-visualizer, use\n--tool=massif, which invokes the\nmassif heap analyzer\ninstead of memcheck.\nAn example of the interactive output produced by massif-visualizer is\npresented:\n\nPerformance profiler\nValgrind has a performance profiler called\ncallgrind. Its\npurpose, like IgProf, is to analyze how much time is spent in each\nfunction. As we have already discussed, being a deterministic tool\nevery single function of your program is trapped and captured, which\nmakes the tool very precise, but also very slow.\nCallgrind's output can be analyzed by means of the KCachegrind program\nthat can be installed on Ubuntu 14.04 with:\nsudo apt install kcachegrind\n\nThe typical way of invoking Valgrind's callgrind for AliRoot programs is:\nvalgrind\n  --tool=callgrind \\\n  --log-file=/tmp/valgrind_callgrind.log \\\n  aliroot -b -q launchMyAnalysis.C+\n\nThe produced output can be browsed interactively by means of KCachegrind. An\noutput similar to the following is presented:\n\nwhere colored blocks indentify graphically which are the functions where your\nprogram spends most of its time.\n"}}}
