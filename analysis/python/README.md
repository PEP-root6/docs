# An introduction to Python

[Python][python] is a programming language. It’s widely used in the
scientific community due to the broad selection of feature-rich, actively 
maintained libraries. This means that a lot of software has already been 
written to solve problems common to our field, so you can concentrate on the 
interesting stuff!

## Aim of these lessons

There are already plenty of superb guides on the Internet for learning 
Python, all of which will be more comprehensive than this one.  We expect you to be familiar with at least one other programming language, so 
that you understand sentences like "we assign value 123 to variable `abc`" and 
"this is a function which accepts two arguments". You should also understand 
the basics of using a text editor, which you use to write code to a file 
somewhere, and then you can somehow run the contents using commands in your 
terminal to make stuff happen.

Sounds good? Then let’s get going!
