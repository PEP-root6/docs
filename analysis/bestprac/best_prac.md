# Best practices

In this section, which probably we will not have time for to cover, some best practices are covered that are aimed at making your life easier. We will cover

* preparing your code for debugging
* general programming tips 
* some debugging pointers
* a brief section about profiling tools

These pages are strongly based on the ones that were used for last year's ALICE analysis tutorial.
